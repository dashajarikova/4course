"I am from old town, and I stayed in this hotel with my mom on her visit.  It had been under renovations for over a year or so, and I was really excited to see what they had done.  It was a beautiful room, view, location.  The decorating is eclectic in a very modern way, but there is still an ""old world"" kind of feel.  The amenities were great (the shower was fantastic, love the hardware!), and the concierge helped us with everything.  It is the only hotel in Old Town with a doorman.  I would never have guessed, but there is a pool on the third floor.  The restaurant downstairs (Jackson 20) is very hip and swanky to go for a drink, and dinner there is very good as well.  I can't wait to go there when it warms up to take advantage of the courtyard and balconies.",Incredible Hotel,5
"We have been coming to the Ocean Park Inn for years. We usually book several rooms for our extended family and friends. The is right for our budget and you dont have to leave the hotel to get breakfast in the morning they have a self serve cafe in house.

"Perfect place for a quick get away. We had a queen room with a shared bathroom. Bed was extremely comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet. There were ear plugs in our room, but we didn't need them even though we were on the fourth floor right below the roof top bar. Staff was great, very informative and helpful. We...

"The room was not the best however, it was good for one night before continuing our trip home. The hallway and the room smelled like cigarette smoke even though we booked a non smoking room. The continental breakfast was fair enough to hold us over until we stopped to eat lunch. Stayed because it was close to the Superman Museum (about 10-15 minutes away).",Good For One Night Stay...,2

Stayed here last night for an overnight stay. I was pretty pleased. I have never stayed at a Best Western and was pleasantly surprised.

"Brand new hotel and a great bargain at 89 per night plus tax. As others mentioned, there was NO RESORT FEE, which was the main reason we chose the Hampton over the nearby Renaissance and Hilton hotels. Our family (all adults) found the Hampton's location convenient. It took only a few minutes walk to the Seaworld parking lot, then crossing the lot to the main entrance took a few more minutes. There are not many businesses in walking distance of the hotel, other than a Bonefish restaurant and a Walgreens store, but several new buildings are being constructed nearby. If the City, Seaworld, and/or Hilton plan the area to be more pedestrian friendly, it will be a big draw for travelers. Rooms are nicely furnished. Beautiful bathrooms, although the only lighting option was VERY bright and the fan was weak (just minor issues). We definitely took advantage of the Hampton's daily breakfast and we appreciated the free coffee and tea, which was available in the lobby 24/7.",Area could be more pedestrian friendly...,4
"Nice location along the same road as the Marriott, which gives you convenient dining and bar options. It also has easy access to one of the many bike/walk/jogging trails located throughout Boulder county. We were impressed in that you can actually ride a bike on these trails between cities.

"This was our first time in Seattle. The first part of our stay was at another hotel but we had to change to the W due to availability. I wish we had just stayed the entire trip at the W. The staff was excellent and the room was amazing. We had a huge room on the 25th floor with a view of the sound as well as the Space Needle. This was the first time we actually spent a great deal of time in the room since the view was spectacular. I would absolutely stay there again should we return to Seattle. IN ALL CAPS TOO, I LOVE IT! We are thrilled that you ended up with us and LOVED it! We wish you would have been at W the whole time as well! The views from the room are AMAZING, we agree! Please let us welcome you back anytime!

"The front desk was extremely friendly, helpful and courtliest -- HIGH marks. They attempted to resolve some issues we had with the room. We were travelling with 4 people including a limited mobility young adult. We booked a suite for additional room, but the shape of the room was difficult to maneuver. The front desk made some furniture changes for us which was helpful. However, the hotel which stated free parking had limited parking on site (overflow was across a highway in an open lot) and only two designated handicapped parking spaces which were mostly occupied. This made travel difficult.",Our overnight at the Holiday inn Express Cambridge,3

Only reason this establishment got a rating of one was because of its complimentary breakfast spread. Otherwise we where made to wait more than an hour and a half for our room at check in.

"Don't read this if you don't like whining, because as I wrote this, I realized that's what it sounds like... sorry, but if you want 3 stars or more, you've got some work to do. So, we got a good rate through Expedia, felt good about that. Checking in, well that's where the disappointments started. The lady at the desk was not friendly at all, sloppy, no smile, etc. We got the room keys and the room was clean, so okay, going better. The HVAC controls didn't seem to work as we thought they should - eventually it seemed like it was okay - cooled the room down nicely. The bathroom could have been really nice, but the paint on the wall was cracked and starting to chip. The edge of the tub had one chip repaired and another not yet repaired. On to breakfast in the morning. Eggs were overcooked and cold, but otherwise it was generally okay - nothing to write home about. We used the side entrance several times and the scanner seemed like it was broken like the enclosure was missing, which made it awkward to slide the access card for entry. It is in a good location, close to the freeway and several fast food places.",Going downhill,2
Hotel was having a remodel when we stayed. Hotel was fine with the exception that when kids r running in the hall and it sounds like a herd of elephants I would expect the front desk to Handle the situation.

"I have to disagree. I think the staff in the hotel lobby were not helpful or friendly at all. A young girl one of the days, didn't seem to care less to help me out with the bus schedule or any kind of help. But the shuttle boys, the bayside bar, and cafe servers in the hotel were AMAZING and helpful though!!!! Thank you to all those guys/gals!!! Ask for Steve if you need a shuttle to/from the airport!! :)Well first off we had a pretty long travel with a bunch of luggage. When we finally got to the hotel.. we got directions to our room (which was on the VERY last block of the hotel.. and 2nd floor) so anyways, we went off to find our room, well the directions we got sucked and we got a little lost, and finally we found it (keep in mind we were lugging around a baby, stroller, carseat, 3 huge luggages, backpack, diaper bag) Oh and not to forget that we had to make two trips up and down the stairs to get all our luggage in. We were sweating bullets when we finally settled in our hotel room. So after a 8 hour travel than getting to our room in tim buck two it was just a diaster!! Ruined my night for sure!! But the room was okay. The view out the balcony was better than what i thought!! A great view of the pool and the garden. And it was cool that we got to sit out on the deck. We had a room in the old building, so it was a little old unsafe feeling i had the entire stay. The beds were pretty comfortable and made nicely. The little fridge was in a cabinet under the TV, which had a little odor in it and sat on a stained shelf. I actually have never experience a Holiday inn as a motel before, but this room made me feel like i was in a motel. I would not stay here again... not unless it was for a cheaper price than what i paid. If i wanted a motel feel like room.. i would of stayed at Days Inn for half the price!Dear Kristen386, Thank you for your stay with us and leaving feedback.

"We were blown away at the dcor and style of this Courtyard Marriott! We were finishing our vacation week which was split between Myrtle and Charleston SC and we had just been very disappointed by our stay in Charleston at the Hyatt Place. This was just what we needed to turn things around! We were going to a show at the House of Blues and it was perfect, just down the street! Plenty of gas, mini golf, food, bars, shopping etc nearby! We arrived early and they did not have rooms ready so they gave us free waters and snacks and although we maybe waited 30 mins for a room they kept checking on us as well as still got us into a room before the posted check in time on 4th of July weekend! I would highly recommend this hotel!!",Great Hotel!,5

"Only problem we had was that we were not informed of the teen basketball tournament going on in the city. As a result, lots of kids, the room next to ours had the TV blaring until midnight and then on again a 5 am. We went to the lobby for our full breakfast at 10:15 and there was nothing left. We pickup a beagle and coffee and went to our room. They should have planned ahead for all the teens to eat all the food. There was 45 minutes left for breakfast time but nothing to eat.

"This hotel is fine. UNLESS you are planning to use the wifi. It's so slow and unstable that it's mostly impossible. I needed to work during my visit and was unable to get anything done. Our room wasn't far from the main office, where I assumed the router was located, but neither of us could get a decent signal and it frequently went out. There are also very few outlets in the rooms. I had to unplug the alarm clock and the lamp (located deep behind the bed) so that the two of us could plug in the things we needed. It would be nice if they'd provide a power strip extension to make this easier. But it wouldn't matter for your computer if you needed to get online.... The rooms are older, but clean. The bathroom has seen better days and the tub's surface is terrible, but that's just age. Nothing felt dirty.

When I called the front desk to complain they were unsympathetic and said they had nothing else available. They offered an aerosol spray to mask the odor which didn't do much.

"We stayed only one night because we were going on a cruise out of Port Canaveral. Having a small bar right in the lobby was very convenient after a long day of travel. Front desk personnel were friendly and the room was adequate once they finally gave us a room that could fit 4 people. Yes they knew in advance there would be 4 people but they originally tried to put us in a room with one bed. We reserved 2 queen beds. But we ended up with a room with a king bed and a fold out couch. Fold out couches are not comfortable for 2 adults. There was a lot of construction. Possibly it may be nice once it is complete. One very strange amenity is offering coffee in the lobby from 11:00am to 5:00pm.

"I've been a fan of SpringHill Suites since staying at one off the strip in Las Vegas. We choose this one in Seattle because we've had good success with previous SpringHill locations. The hotel is about a mile away from both the Space Needle and Pike Market. We walked once from the Needle back to the hotel and it wasn't too bad of a walk (one mild hill.) The other times we took the free hotel shuttle which will drop you off and pick you up at these two landmark attractions. The neighborhood around the hotel isn't the best, but I've seen worse. We felt relatively comfortable/safe walking around the area and ate at the Pho restaurant one block west of the hotel. There is a Starbucks across the street to the South of the hotel but it may only be open on weekdays as it is attached to an office building. Compared to the hotels nearest the city's landmarks and downtown, the price of SpringHill Suites was less. The buffet breakfast (hot and cold items) was good, though it can get crowded. Luckily, the bar area provides additional seating at peak times and they will open the conference area for seating (if nothing is scheduled.) My only gripe is the cost of valet parking. It comes with the territory (in-city accomodations) and was quite a bit cheaper than hotels right at the city center but I still don't like to pay for parking. Very close to I5 with very good access to I5 South on ramp.This is a really great description of our services, David -- thanks so much for taking the time to share this with those looking into our hotel. I'm happy that you were able to make good use of our shuttles to see the city, although I wish the price of our valet parking hadn't been a disappointment. As you mentioned, valet parking is an inevitable part of city life, but hopefully our other services more than made up for it. Speaking of which, good note about our breakfast -- we can get a little busy, and it's a helpful note for fellow travelers. Hope to see you on your next trip to Seattle!

Loved our room-was a corner room with 2 queens, very comfortable. Favorite part was the lobby, just a great place to hang out, nice bar, fun games, music at night, really cool area. We will be back!Mich, MISHA is amazing! We are glad you chose our hotel for the B-Day celebration and that we took good care of you. Of course you don't have to wait for his birthday to come back, we can help write a new Rx if needed: Phillies, Bell, Parkway, Casino, Shopping, Kimmel Center, Concerts, Theater, just to name a few :) See you soon!

"I found this hotel on the internet. It was located where we wanted to be and seemed to be a bit unique. It was a great experience. The hotel is done in a newspaper theme with unique art, historic photos, carpet and accessories. The rooms, (I rented two for our group) were comfortable, clean, nicely appointed. We could walk to...

However, after traveling all day I really wasn't in the mood to walk back downstairs with my stuff to change rooms again.",Bay City Beautiful,4
"We recently had a great stay at the Hotel Allegro. Upon arriving, it is like traveling back in time as you are greeted by a grand staircase! The staff was warm and helpful from the front desk to the concierge to the bell man. Although I had the idea that the rooms were on the small side, our original room seemed smaller (and not accurately represented on their website) than I had expected. I inquired about it at the front desk and the lovely young woman who helped me (I am awfully sorry I do not remember her name to give her recognition!) was amazing. She said although it appeared that the category of the room was correct, she said that she was surprised that we had not been upgraded as Inner Circle members. She immediately switched our room to a much larger king suite. We really appreciate this kind of service! The location of the Hotel Allegro is central: in the Loop, walkable to shopping, Millennium Park, and restaurants, block or so from Clark/Lake Blue Line to the airport. We would definitely stay again!Hello!We're so happy to hear that you had great interactions with our team and that were able to get upgraded and enjoy your sweet suite!

"My other half and I always enjoy Aloft hotels wherever we go for the modern decor, pet friendliness, and good value. Downtown Philadelphia is no exception. The location is absolutely perfect. You walk right outside and are staring at City Hall on Broad Street. If it wasnt so stinking cold it would have been an ideal location for walkability. Rooms were as expected for Aloft, and value was great as usual. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return when it isnt so cold outside. Hi Micah, 5 STARS! Wow, thank you! Glad you enjoyed our hotel and of course the perfect location. The weather gods were a little off in their timing for your visit.

We booked and paid in full a month in advance. We arrived late to be greeted by front desk telling us we had no room available. It was common practice to overbook. We spent 2 of our 3 days moving from hotel to hotel as a result. They did not even call us ahead of time to tell us to check In elsewhere.  Instead of a refund for the inconvienance the Manager gave us 2 free drink tickets and offered a free nights stay later. Horrible custom service and practice!,Book in advance and arrive to no room!,2

"This is a real nice Spring Hill Suites. The front counter staff is very well trained I left some suite cases here for a week as I was traveling around Washington when asked the front counter staff if I could do this Absolutely I said they are kind of large not a problem. The next morning when I went to leave them I explained to the lady the gentleman said I could leave them and shes like of course no one said let me get the manager let me see etc. etc. just an empowered staff to satisfy guests. I also had problem with the HVAC system upon check in they sent maintenance up within 10min could not correct the problem he apologized for the inconvenience and that I needed to go back down to the front desk to switch rooms, again front counter staff apologizing and the gentleman looked hard for the closest room on the same floor and finds one two doors down.As for other things the bar is good, great prices for hotel bar and do not remember ever seeing one in a Spring Hill Suites, breakfast is a little above average for this grade of hotel. Rooms for Spring Hill are on par and about what you would expect. Location is good depending where youre walking if you dont mind walking an extra 4-5 blocks from where immediate downtown hotels are to places like Pikes Place it is fine it is also a lot closer to what I think they call the area capitol hill again you need to be ok with walking since you walk up a big hill about three blocks and youre in a great area with many restaurants and bars and no tourists.You also get free use of 24hr. fitness across the street and internet. I did not have a car but think they charge for parking so just beware to calculate that in your budget. Would stay again when in Seattle.",Good hotel great staff,5
I have to admit it... I am a high maintenance Hotel customer. I like to stay at nicer places because they make me feel like I'm somebody important.

"Me and a friend stayed here on the last leg of our 6 week American adventure for 3 nights. When we arrived the first receptionist was quite short and boderline rude however the manager took over (Gutted I can't remember his name) and he could not have been more helpful. We had a few conversations with him and he was a genuinely lovely man who couldn't have been more helpful.There are no lifts in this hotel, however the aforementioned manager helped us up the many stairs with our luggage. I have never stayed in a shared bathroom hotel before but it was not as bad as I envisioned. They were always immaculate and never too much of a wait as there were 3 toilets on our floor.I would say if you are a younger traveller this may not be the hotel for you as we did get told off for laughing too loudly with some travellers from neighbouring rooms, however this was completely justified, just if you're after a more lively scene, pick a hotel with sound proofed rooms! There are no TV's in the room's and they are quite small but if, like us, you are after a relaxed vibe when you get in, this is great. (Another reviewer compared this hotel to 'staying at grandma's' and I couldn't agree more)The location of the hotel was absolutely perfect. In some parts of San Fran I did feel slightly unsafe but could not fault the location of the San Remo at all, a quieter, friendly area. Opposite there is a great little cafe, Caffe Cappiccio (Helpful as the hotel does not provide a breakfast), some bars (our favourite being La Rocas) and a 10 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf. The restaurant of the hotel was absolutely brilliant. The food was delicious and there was a fantastic band playing while we were eating who also did a great rendition of happy birthday to my friend.All in all, this hotel was a great little find and I would love to see what the penthouse is like!Again, thank you to the manager, your customer service was impeccable.Thank you so much for your comments and feedback. Our staff are well-trained and expected to help our guests above and beyond, just like Kenley (our manager) did. We will look into the front desk staff you mentioned, as we are in the hospitality business and expect the best from our staff.Besides being close to many famous attractions, our neighborhood is very safe.

"This was a convenient and fairly priced place to stay in San Diego. We were 20 minutes to Sea World and downtown. Friends who stayed downtown had to pay 50 per night for parking. We never had a chance to use the courtyard pool but we appreciated the pastry, egg, sausage, cereal, and waffle breakfast options. Perfect for us that they start serving at 6am. Room was clean and everything was in working order. Beds were a bit on the firm side. WiFi didn't work with the password we were given. Our main goal was a safe clean place in San Diego with breakfast within a budget and this Best Western checked those boxes. It is no longer a Best Western Plus. You can see the old sign on the ground in the parking lot. I forgot to ask front desk about the change. The breakfast included with the price of the room still makes them better than other Best Western hotels in the area but there must be other requirements to keep the Plus title. Dear mrsp-alisoviejoThank you for taking the time to review the hotel. We greatly appreciate your feedback. Thank you for mentioning that we are only 20-25 minutes away from most our attractions here in San Diego. One of the benefits of staying up in Miramar is that you get better pricing since we are not next to our attractions.

"Nous avons pass 2 semaines en aot 2013 avec notre fils de 7 ans. Notre avis est trs positif, habituellement on part en hotel club o on se retrouve loin de tout ! L c'tait diffrent, l'hotel est situ sur une longue pietonne (par la sortie de derrire) o on peut trouver une multitude de boutiques et de restos colls la plage Carihuela. Nous avons pris une formule en demi-pension et on ne regrette pas ce choix. Le petit djeuner est classique : buffet volont sans attente. Il n'y a pas de vrai jus d'orange seulement une sorte de sirop chimique. Au diner, on a toujours trouv quelque chose de bon manger, aucune queue pour aucun produit. Le personnel est trs agrable et au petits soins avec les clients. En revanche, l'eau est payante : 2,10 euros la bouteille de 50 cl (plate ou gazeuse). Autre mauvais point, en sortant du resto les vetement sentent fort la nourriture. La piscine est toute petite mais souvent vide, j'y suis all 2 ou 3 fois : mon fils tait presque seul dedans et moi j'tais sur un transat avec de la lecture. Les soirs dans le bar, il y a une animation : groupe de danse flamencon, chanteur ou mini club. A minuit souvent tout s'arrte pour laisser les gens dormir tranquillement. En sortant de l'hotel par derrire, droite 30 mtres sur la pietonne, il y a une agence de voyage qui propose des excursions moins chres que l'hotel. Nous sommes parti Grenade avec eux avec visite de l'alhambra. Seul bmol, le car fait le tourne des hotels",Hotel vraiment sympa,4

"Well when we arrived at the hotel, the front desk staff was pleasant. We checked in and went to our room to notice that walls looked slightly painted over and chipped. The towels had stains on them, which to me felt like they were not cleaned properly or that they havent purchased any newer towels. When I retrieved ice from the ice machine, there were black particles in my ice. I returned to the ice machine to retrieve a fresh bucket and ended in the same result. When I went downstairs to notify the front desk staff of the incident, they had a very callus attitude, which came of as very unapologetic or apathetic. I then requested that they give me some ice from behind the desk, to which they did. The next morning when I was departing for my day, I was informed that the water would be shut off for a few hours for maintenance. I left the building at 10 am and returned at 3 pm expecting the water to turn back on as I was informed it would take 3 hours to fix. When I arrived at my room, the water was still turned off, when I asked what the status was, I was informed shortly. I then requested that my room have running water by the time I return again by 7 pm because I need to freshen up for my evening and I would move to another hotel if this was an issue. When I returned, the water was made available, however it had a slight ting of rust color it. All in all, these things made for a not so pleasant stay at Quality Suites Intercontinental West.",Bad Ice Machines and No Running Water,2

"I stayed here for a couple of comp'd nights and had heard that the rooms were remodeled, so I was looking forward to it and had somewhat lofty expectations. I was admittedly impressed. The room was larger than expected, tastefully decorated, and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond. It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!",Fantastic room with a view!,4

"This hotel is awesome when it comes to comfort and convenience. It has some great views of Chicago and is centrally located in the downtown area. The hotel staff was great and very attentive. We attended both bar areas on 2 separate nights and were given poor customer service. The 1st night the staff seemed angry that we had such a large group. They didn't appreciate our business. This was the rooftop lounge. The 2nd night, the waitress literally threw a menu at us. When we talked to the manager about it, he didn't seem to care about our concern. Dear Diana G, Thank you for choosing the Conrad Chicago for your recent stay downtown. I am so sorry you experienced such poor and negative attitude from our team in both restaurants and lounges. That is certainly not the image nor the guest experience we strive for and train for on a daily basis. Please know that your comments have been taken seriously, cascaded to the appropriate leaders and we will ensure this does not happen in the future. Thank you for not allowing this incidence to take away from your overall experience and we appreciate you sharing your feedback. We hope to welcome you back in the future.",Great hotel with great ammenties. Lousy customer service in bar areas,5
"From first sight, it looks old & beaten up. But I still decided to take a chance. Walked into the lobby to check in & there was a lot of strangers walking in & out. Once I got my key & went into the room, the room smelled like someone had died in there. There was dead bugs on the floor, the TV cables were cut open, no door to the restroom, the restroom smelled beyond disgusting & the windows were broken but taped. My husband and I were so mad, we went back to cancel and get out money back. DO NOT stay here. It's very shady and disgusting. Never again. They should be reported.",HORRIBLE!!!,1
"We had the Mary Simpson Room, it is TINY and the decor is very, very dated. Beware that the toilet and shower for this room at least is separate from the room and to use it you need to leave the room and cross the hall at the top of the main stairs to get to it ...... But hey they supply a robe to make it better :( Leaving the room also allows anyone passing to see straight in to your room and with the bed being right there exposes your partner to 'rubber necking' too. I guess this place suits people looking for a certain old worldliness etc, but for an overnight stop on the way down the coast it is best avoided, we didn't even take our cases up to our room as 1. You have to enter the house from the rear and wind your way through the downstairs rooms to get to the stairs (no lift) 2. There was not enough room in the room for us and our luggage. On a positive note, the breakfast was nice",Tiny B&B,3

"Frankly, I reserved this hotel because it was the cheapest decent property I could find in downtown Seattle. So I wasn't expecting much when we checked in. We were pleasantly surprised. The rooms are small and the building is old, but they've done a good job of making the best of it. I've seen it described as quaint and that's a fair description. It has the look and feel of an old classic place. It's clean and well-maintained, and they've done a good job of updating the necessary amenities. They also have a sister property across the street with which they share facilities (ie. laundry). It's nothing special, and yet it is. They have a good (albeit expensive) restaurant in the lobby, which means breakfast is pricey, but there's a decent place a block away called Corner Caf. The only thing I really missed is a fridge and microwave.Hello Traveler - Thank you for your review.

"We stayed here early February 2016 for our honeymoon. Overall our experience was fantastic. Spice was our favorite restaurant for dinner. Barcelona has an awesome breakfast buffet. The staff was always ready to take our order at all bars and servers on the beach visited often to make sure drinks were full. We stayed in a ocean view swim up pool excellence club room. We didn't use our outdoor bed and the pool as much as we thought only because the sun was gone by noonish, which was too bad. Our room did have a musty smell that I was unfortunately excited to leave by the 7th day so I would stay in an upper level ocean view next time. We will definitely go back!! The room just wasn't 100 worth the upgraded cost for the club and the swim up portion of it. We didn't utilize the excellence club as much as others might.. So probably wouldn't do that again either. Many daily activities. The shows at night were great, for the most part.. We were looking forward to the Michael Jackson show which they advertised was going to be happening the Thursday night we were there but they changed it to the following Thursday, out of our control but I was disappointed as we heard such great things about it. We met many people who were visiting for the second time so that was encouraging to hear. We also heard from many others in all their travels elsewhere similar, this was the best place! Which I could definitely understand. Everything is a short walk away from your room! I suggest a visit! :)",Excellent resort,4

We stayed in building 6 in room 641 top floor at the end of the building, nice size room. The room was dated but the bed was comfortable. Microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker are nice amenities. There was a sitting area with a chair and a small, uncomfortable couch. The carpet at minimum could use a good cleaning, but the rooms really need updating. If you only plan on using the room to crash after a great day of sightseeing this hotel is perfect.","Great location, Good price, OK rooms",3

"We were in New Orleans for 5 days, staying at the St. James, just 2 blocks from the edge of the French Quartera great location, within walking distance but in a quieter neighbourhood. The hotel is older, but its public spaces are beautifully appointed in soothing neutrals and comfortable faux-classic furniture the shady courtyard is perfect for hanging out with friends, wine, and snacks. In our part of the two building complex, our room was small, but clean, andreflective of the age of the buildingboasted doors which had to be muscled shut and floors which creaked and dipped however, thats a heritage building for you and we could see that renovations had been made over the years. The staff, without exception, had to be the most friendly and pleasant group we have ever had the pleasure of meeting. From Miss Michelle at the front desk, to Miss Audrey who delivered our courtesy croissants and coffee every morning, to Pedro at the door, one and all greeted us with smiles and quips, waves and queries about our stay, and in general took excellent care of us from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. It was our first trip to New Orleans and we feel we lucked out in finding the hidden gem that is the St. James on Magazine St.We can't thank you enough for your review!

My stay here was pretty cool for the 1st time. This was my 1st time getting a hotel by myself and the experience was cool and relaxing. At 1st I was hesitant about getting a hotel here because of the rating but good thing I decided to check it out for myself. The only few thing was that the bathroom fan is loud and the actual unit only blew out cold air. But other than that it was very relaxing.,Pretty Cool Place,4

"We were here for 2 nights. It is a decent hotel for the price and breakfast was a plus. Workout area and pool area was nice to have. Upon arrival the front desk attendant was having trouble with the computer. I had to wait a good 30 minutes to check in. This wouldn't have been so terrible if I didn't have 4 heavy bags, and an infant with me. It was also late at night, so of course I just wanted to put my son back to bed. The breakfast was ok. The eggs were a little watery the first morning. The microwave dial was sticky when I went to use it for the first time. I stayed there 2 nights and the 2nd day my key did not work. And as far as I could tell, others did not either. I had to again carry my infant son back down the front desk, and he was awoken from his nap because of this. The TV did not work the second evening I stayed here. It was supposedly not from the hotel but a cable provider issue.","Okay stay for the price, room for improvement",3

Started in a room that initially we liked. As my wife was prep for bed the smell of tobacco started to bother her coming from the desk. She called about the situ and was told that we could move to a handicapped room. Did not want that.

"My family and I visit La Jolla every year for the Challenged Athletes Foundation Triathlon. We try different hotels every year. This year we stayed at the beautifully appointed Pantai Inn. Our room was very well renovated with a full kitchen and awesome bathroom. Spacious and clean, but the master bed was a double and too small for comfort. My daughter slept on the Murphy Bed. Unfortunately, we heard every noise from the upstairs unit. The jumping, walking and screaming was very unsettling and kept us from relaxing. There was a beeping noise outside our bedroom the entire which kept us from sleeping. To say the least the location is great and property really nice, but we wouldn't suggest staying there for a romantic, relaxing or quiet weekend. Dear Friend,Thank you so much for your comments, we appreciating hearing from our guests.I am truly sorry to hear your stay at Pantai Inn was disrupted by the guests in the room above you. The Inn was sold out that weekend for the Challenged Athletes Foundation Triathlon. If we would have had another room we would have gladly upgraded you to something that was not below other guests. I hope you understand this is not a normal occurrence at the Inn. Most of our guests come here for a quiet romantic getaway and hopefully you will give us another opportunity to serve you again.

It's limited and if the have any groups at the hotel then you're parking in side streets. When I was there they had the parking garage closed for steam cleaning and striping. Had to walk in from very dark side streets each night...not a safe situation. They wanted to still charge for parking each night even when we parked off site.

We recently stayed at the Best Western Yacht Harbor Inn In San Diego. It is a great little hotel right down on the Harbor. The rooms could use a little updating . The bathrooms are starting to show their age. The staff was very nice. I asked to be moved to a harbor view room and they were very helpful in making that happen.The continental breakfast was really good. They had many wonderful choices of both hot and cold items.The yogurt parfaits and the pancake machine seemed to be very popular. Our room on the 5th floor had a spectacular view of the harbor. The hotel really does have a great location. It has a pool and hot tub. If you stay there take the time and go for a walk on the harbor. this property is located near the zoo and sea world. If you need to unload your luggage. Make sure and park out front and use the lobby doors. Otherwise you will be hauling your luggage up some stairs. The parking garage is located off the back of the lobby and you need to use the stairs.Thank you for sharing your experience with Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel.

"The Galleria Park has become my downtown hotel when attending conferences at Moscone Center. It's a lot more relaxing and personal than the bad-service-mega-Marriott or other downtown choices. Being on the 'other' side of Market means you discard all (well almost all) the other conference go-ers, giving yourself a break from the noise and crowd. The hotel is small and quiet and the staff is excellent, going out of their way to make you feel welcome. Coffee and wine are served complementary in the morning and early evening (respectively). I have just two small issues which prevented this review from being an EXCELLENT. First, our room was REALLY small this time the bathroom sink was in the bedroom, and the shower was so tiny my husband couldn't really fit in it. Previously, my rooms have been somewhat larger. Second, the staff was unable to give me a good restaurant recommendation for dim sum... I know I can't expect the front desk to replace a concierge, but this seems like a pretty common request. But otherwise, the stay was great and I will do it again!Dear Janae L,Thank you for the lovely review of our property. We are so proud to be your go-to downtown SF hotel when attending conferences. We're glad to know you find our atmosphere to be more relaxing and personal than the stereotypical conference hotels. We also love the compliments of the team as we aim to deliver service that is friendly yet professional for every guest who walks through our doors. I do apologize regarding the lack of dim sum restaurant recommendations - be sure to hunt me down next time... I've got a few places in mind! We hope to see you again for the next convention!Best,Jordan Whitney",Another very good visit at the Galleria Park,4
"A 4 star rating tells you that a hotel has a keen eye for details and unexpected pleasures and smiles are expected. That is not this hotel. I booked because of experience with Kimpton hotels in other cities. This one does not meet the Kimpton standard. Examples: Showerhead that stays in one position (straight down because of faulty bracket), toilet that runs and hums long after the flush (don't think that's a feature), a totally dysfunctional internet, which they acknowledge was on the blink. Overall, the hotel just needs some management attention and it could easily be brought up to standard 4 star. It is not at the moment a 4 star.",Good Location; Needs Better Management,4

Our stay was great until we received attitude from pool area staff because they kept asking if we needed something and when we would say no they started having attitudes toward us.

How great was that She sat down with us and completely reviewed the map of the area and pointed out so many tips and suggestions. Pedro, our doorman was also superb and was always there with a smile and ready to answer our slew of touristy questions. Each day we started our day with fresh croissants and coffee delivered to our room. Hotels don't even have to do this nowadays and I certainly think it was a great touch. The hotel was beautiful with a lot of charm, and conveniently located so we could walk to the French Quarter or get to a trolley to go anywhere we would like.

"3.5 stars for this one. The staff were very friendly and kind. The room was a bit dirty, walls and doors needed a scrub. Internet while free was not very reliable and the tv/cable was outdated. Loved the fact that the entire hotel is nonsmoking but that just meant that all the smokers were gathered outside the front door, causing everyone to walk through the smoke to enter the hotel.",Very satisified.,3

After arriving from a very long drive, walked in to find a huge hole in the wall, power outlets poking out of the wall, burns in the comforter, phone didn't work and no remote for our t.v.. The next day took the family sightseeing only to return to our dirty room that was never cleaned. The housekeepers never left clean towels that's when they did decide to clean our room.

The front desk was great but the cleaning crew was horrible . When we first checked in the room wasn't ready . It was just after 3PM so we decided to come back at around 8:30PM. When we went to the room the linen was full of hair. We called the front desk and they were very accommodating and gave us a new set but at this point we were very disappointed . The hotel is also only 3 floors and it took what felt like forever for the elevator to come. Over 10 minute waiting time on average . They don't have any other elevators and were transporting the garbage on the same elevators as the guests which stunk the elevator up like a garbage disposal. When we needed to get any dinnerware we had to ask at the front desk because the room had none and we had to wait for it to be washed because apparently they don't have any clean ones readily available. We will not be staying at this extended stay hotel ever ! It's sad because the front desk staff was extremely nice as well.,Disappointed,1

The central location makes the unique views, the worldclass shopping and the renowned cultural hotspots equally accessible.

"Hotel overall is decent, room was clean. Your choices in this area are pretty limited to begin with. But in our room there was absolutely no sound protection in one wall. I could clearly hear every word and movement from our next-door neighbors, who were drunk on Saturday night but not being unreasonably loud. You can always hear certain muffled noises in hotels, but this was incredible. I literally could have joined in their conversation, I could hear everything perfectly. We should have realized because we could hear the maids earlier in the day. It may be confined to the top floor, all the noise was coming from the ceiling / top of wall.",Something is wrong with Room 425.,2

"We spent 3 nights (24.10.11 to 26.10.11) at this hotel as part of a whirlwind city break. It was difficult to find a hotel in New York that could accomodate 2 families of 4 in 2 rooms within our tight budget, but this place fitted the bill. The rooms were not huge but there was space sufficient for 4 individuals per room and the beds were very comfortable.The service from all members of staff was first class at all times and the General manager (Frank Cortese) was exceptionally helpful beforehand, giving us advice by email of the best way to see the city.The location is ideal for Times Square and other places of interest and we'd definitely use this hotel again. Breakfast was included although the eating area is small. There being only 2 lifts to cater for 30-odd floors is a bit of a drawback if you happen to be above the 6th floor, but we only experienced a problem on 1 occasion and it wasn't the end of the world.",Basic But Comfortable,4

"This used to be a Travelodge, but the name change didn't help. The people on staff were likeable enough, but they need a refresher course in how to make rooms ready for the next guest. I had to go to the front desk for hand towels (they gave me a bath towel), washcloths and drinking cups for the bathroom--all missing from my room. Even worse, when I went to take a shower, there was a used piece of soap in there. Finally, there was no bathmat--combined with a slippery floor, that could have easily been a lawsuit waiting to happen. The rate was average for a place of this type, but I've stayed at other places that cost this little and the bathrooms were pleasingly stocked. Sorry--can't recommend this one.",Never Again...,2

"I was disappointed with this Quality Inn location. I have stayed at Quality Inn in other locations that's why I chose this hotel thinking I would get the same service and quality. Our first room smelled and was not very clean. The shower curtain had a nasty rip and the bedding looked dirty. Fortunately we were allowed to change rooms without much grief. The second room was not much better. The fire suppressors were corroded which made me wonder if they worked, the bathroom door knob was hanging off the door. I had to get a screwdriver to tighten the screws. Again, we were not sure if the bed spread was clean because there were stains on it. There was no fridge in this room even though we had one in the previous room. We had an early start our last morning there and Complimentary breakfast was from 7a.m. to 10a.m. The sign in the lobby clearly stated there was complimentary coffee from 4a.m. to 7a.m. When my wife asked the clerk on duty just to make sure, she was told that there was no coffee before the 7a.m. brunch and that the sign was clearly wrong. There were two other couples in our group that stayed at this hotel and they were not impressed with the hotel either. On the bright side, WiFi service was free and the signal was great. Complimentary breakfast was good and well stocked throughout our stay and the price was reasonable. I've stayed at other Quality Inn's and I would probably do it again but not at this location.",Not Too Happy,1

"Arrived late with young child to find out the hotel was under construction. Had to enter building thru a side door which was located in a dark area near large disposal area, fencing, and under trees (a little scary). The check-in/lobby was in a room, where the attendant just checked me in but didn't greet me properly. Further, we didn't make any mention of the hotel being under construction, offer any advance apology for the inconvenience, or direct me to how to find the elevator to get to my room. On the way to room, it literally looked like we were in a construction zone - walls were unfinished, taping everywhere, floors undone... it really looked like the hotel or that area at least should have been closed. The room itself was much smaller than I imagined and the bathroom/shower was not 100 clean. I've stayed at a lot of Marriott's and this was my worst experience.",Very disappointed Marriott guest...,1

There was a small bathroom with a fair size shower enclosure which all functioned well. There was complimentary WiFi and TV with a fair number of channels to choose from. All the staff were very helpful and polite. Any sort of breakfast was non existent except for complimentary tea or coffee in the morning on a floor above the lobby. I have two gripes one is valet parking. I realise that parking in all large cities is very difficult but the charge that the Galleria makes is excessive. It amounted to 45 a day. My second gripe is with phone calls and the charges made. I made an 8 minute call to Monterey some 120 miles idistance n the same state and was charged 12 again another excessive charge.

Very comfortable room and quiet location not far from the freeway. Will definitely be back,Excellent for the price!,5
"Spend 2 nights in this lovely resort. The reception area is just splendid with a great view of the sea, but not for the unfit as there's just too much stairs to move around. Staff was very helpful althought I do have problems trying to get extra pillow during the night time as they told me I can only get it in the morning as the house keeping is not avail at night. Not too far away from the main area although a little bit of travelling to reach is a must. The resort is kinda smack in the middle of the main area on both side but will need transport to reach. Quite during the night with a bar just opposite the resort for those who wants to grab a quick drink will be great. All in all it's good enough to make it a pleasant stay.",Waking up to a beautiful sea view,3

"My wife and I stayed at Hotel Monaco to celebrate out wedding anniversary and it was one of the worst hotel experience we have had. Do not let the decor fool you. Our first room on the 4th floor was like having your bedroom set in a dog kennel, with dog owners leaving their pets unattended in their room while they were dinning and going out. Those poor dogs were barking to death and we asked to be moved. With our luck we were put next door to a room with about 10 people drinking and partying loudly until quite late which prompted us to move again. They put us on the 6th floor in a beat up room with its wallpaper coming off. It was not fully furnished compared to the other 2 rooms we saw previously. It had an ikea plastic chair and only one window the size of a basement window with a broken rolling shade (I wish I could attach the pictures I took). To top it off our room was right across the 3 elevators and their lovely bells that rang all night long. We could not sleep without earplugs. No boutique hotel would have rooms facing the elevators. There usually is a hallway design such as no bedroom door would be 10 feet away from the elevators. This is not a boutique hotel, not even close. More like a bad Holiday Inn.",Miserable staycation,1
"Stayed at the OPI during Spring Break March '15. This hotel is right on Pacific Beach and is in the heart of all the action. LOts of close by restaurants and drinking available within walking distance. The rooms could use some updating and the hallways definitely need some sprucing up. Our room had a nicely updated bathroom with large walk in shower. The exterior of the hotel is very nice and updated along with a new pool/hot tub area. All new sun loungers around the pool with umbrellas for some shade. They also have a large wicker trunk of beach toys available for kids to take to the beach so no need to buy any.The breakfast items were limited but very handy before heading out for a day full off activity. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. They had great recommendations for restaurants and local activities.Overall a great place to stay while in San Diego.Walter, thank you for taking the time to provide us with a helpful review. We are very pleased to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. furthermore, we are glad that you were able to enjoy some of the great attractions that Pacific Beach has to offer. From excellent local restaurants, to craft beers at nearby bars, to spending the day at the beach, there is something for the whole family to enjoy. Thank you for acknowledging our recently renovated bath rooms and pool furniture, we make a conscious effort to upgrade various parts of the hotel throughout the year and we hope to see you back again soon so you can see some of our newer renovations.",Location is the best!,4

"The hotel has been thoroughly modernized and is great and very fresh. The size of the rooms and bathrooms in the main hotel is great. We did not stay in the of the rooms out by the pool. There was a slight issue when checking in as we called in the morning and requested connecting rooms as we had a 3 adults and 2 four year olds and a two and a half year old. When we checked in we were taken to the 9th floor first and no connection then to the 10th floor and no connection and then down to the 3rd floor and found connecting there. Kyle the bell hop was great and stayed with us on the radio so we did not have to travel up and down with cart and kids. They handled it well and resolved it quickly. Kyle did an excellent job of taking care of us. The only thing I would say is questionable is the pool area in the indoor area floor. The floor is very slippery and dangerous and we were quite surprised when we were there that the hotel has not done something to change that after all the money they spent on the remodel.Also had a bit of trouble everytime we left parking lot with room keys and the parking kiosk. Took several times and a buzz to the inside to get the gate up. We were not the only ones, everyone we came across was having trouble exiting the hotel parking lot. Maybe they should come up with a new system. Laundry area was nice and very clean and bright. They may want to considering adding one more of each machine as they have only one now, but it was a large room with plenty of space and very clean. The restaurant breakfast buffet was excellent and the staff in the restaurant and bar area were very good.The business center was great with new computers and a great printer. Would definitely stay again.",Great remodel,5

"I was looking for a (relatively) inexpensive place to stay for a week long course. The hotel was conveniently located for me. It has excellent beach access. Rooms are small with some inconveniences, but adequate. Parking spaces are way too narrow. You can park entirely within the marked lines and still have trouble getting into and out of your car. Overall it met my needs, and I would certainly consider staying there again.",Adequate and very convenient.,4

"The Mountain Lodge has an outstanding appearance from the outside. It has a log cabin feel with excellent lighting. The outdoor pool and hot tub are also a plus in addition to the lounges that surround the pool area. The hotel staff were extremely helpful with showing us how to use the gondolas and where the various hiking trail heads were located they even gave us an outstanding map. The main drawbacks of the hotel are the small size of the room and the lack of sound deadening between rooms. At check-in, the person tried to upgrade us to a larger room (for 60 more a night) however, since we were already paying over 200 a night, we declined to upgrade. Anyway, the room we were in was next to a utility room with a loud hot water heater that cycled on and off all night. Also, the walls were so thin that we could hear the conversations of the people next to us. To top it off, there were two rooms near us with barking dogs one two doors down and one right across the hall. We found out later that they put the people with pets on the first floor therefore, I suggest that you request a room off of the first floor if you don't want to hear pet noises. All-in-all the stay was fine but the amount of noise in the room was unacceptable.",Mountain Lodge good but can be improved,3
We came into the hotel and everything looked like it was not very clean. We finaly got checked in and walked into our room and I was knocked over by the musty oder in the room. I walked into the bathroom and the smell was worse plus I could see shoe marks on the tile floor. I requested another room and that one was just as bad. The hotel is VERY OLD and I would of went to another hotel but I couldn't get my money back. DONT STAY HERE !!!! The area is not so safe.,Long check in.,1
"The room was very nice and the hotel was quiet. Since we were visiting for Parent Weekend at OU, we only stayed one night.

"I'm not a fan of hotels that get along with the bare minimum to keep a place running. It looks decent from the outside, but once inside you can tell that not much effort is put in, to making it pleasing. The carpet is old and smelly, walls are haphazardly painted, cracks everywhere, nothing feels super clean and fresh. I understand that it is a roadside hotel, but you should always want to present your business with your best foot forward. The name is actually Quality Inn, not Comfort Inn. Breakfast was okay. All in all, I wasn't impressed.",Okay if you just need a place to crash.,2
"I felt the room was dated and cheaply appointed. The TV was small. The Mini fridge was not turned on and warm. There was no coffee pot thus no way to make coffee. And the biggest annoyance was there was no Water in the room and a vending machine in the hall with 3.00 a bottle water. Really. Charging for drinking water and NOTHING available in the room.

The room was the exact same room with the exact same view as a friend had on the 21st floor. What I will say is the bathroom is fabulous. Soaking tub and separate shower, large vanity, robes.

We were upgraded to a bigger room on the top floor and it was fantastic. The bed is great and the air conditioning kept the room really cool. Plenty of wardrobe space, a fridge and coffee making facilities. The only slight downside was the bathroom was reletively small in comparison. The wine happy hour is a nice touch and when we arrived (during happy hour) the hotel staff offered us to take a glass up to our room with us. The gym is small but adequate, the same for the walking/jogging track outside. The hotel is in a great location. An Uber from the airport cost about 30 Dollars.

"As others have said, this is a great little place within a few blocks of the Fisherman's Wharf area. It is clean and well kept, and the staff were very good. Noah at the front desk was very informative and up on the weather around the bay area as well. We stayed here two different nights in one week, before and after our travels into wine country, and were very satisfied. We chose The Columbus Motor Inn rather than some possibly bigger named places because of the price, but more for the assurance that we would have a parking space at our hotel and not have to search the downtown streets for parking, or pay some outrageous fee to park after we already were paying the hotel. What a great decision as parking was a real PITA in the city, everywhere. If you could find parking on the streets, most of it was metered, and some questionable. If you were lucky to find a safe looking garage, it was expensive. On the wharf they wanted 7 per hour, so we just walked from the hotel! Factor that into your decision. The rooms were comfortable and the flat-screen TV was nice as well. I'll make this one of my favorite places for certain! I'll post a picture taken from our room looking down Columbus toward the pyramid and the Coit Tower.",Walk to Fisherman's Wharf,5
"I traveled to Pueblo on business and stayed at the Wingate. There was ample parking and the hotel is easy to find. The front desk was very welcoming and the room was spacious and quite. The bed was comfortable and the room was very large and comfortable as well. The WiFi worked well and was fast. The breakfast was a basic hot breakfast with egg omelets and sausage, juice from a dispenser, donuts, coffee, tea, etc. Fresh fruit would have been a nice addition. All in all, a very good place to stay for business in Pueblo.",Good place to stay for business in Pueblo,5
It is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location. Smack dab in the middle of Bourbon St. It was really easy to get to off of the highway. Parking at the hotel was a breeze as well.

Also, Bart Montgomery stop is only about two blocks away so transportation from the airport round trip was only about 18 per person. Dear JeremiahP,Thank you for sharing your feedback with us!

We stayed on a Thursday and again on Friday going to and coming back from family in the area. The first night we booked a 2 bed and received a king with a sofa. Dead tired from driving 8 hrs (3am) I didn't ask for the correct room. The front desk man was very polite and I'm sure he would've switched us. My son who's 11 complained the sofa bed was very uncomfortable. We were on 4th floor and bedding was very nice and bed comfortable. Great water pressure and hot. We decided to stay again on way home. Lady who checked us in was borderline rude like we were inconveniencing her. Got 3rd floor 2 beds. Beds squeaked at the slightest touch and were hard and lumpy. Clumpy pillows felt like they had been washed and dried and were small squares. Very uncomfortable. Shower never got hit and water pressure not great- had a hard time believing this was same hotel.,Not consistent,3
The hotel was great. We drove in and our room was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed room service and the staff was great. Will stay here again when in Suffolk.,Great Stay,5
"This was our 2nd stay at PACIFIC SHORES INN. Last January we visited and booked again this year because we were so delighted with the property. Travelling with two small dogs can be difficult and staying here made it quite easy. There is a reasonable fee of course, but everyone was kind and open to their presence. We had 3 adults staying in a ground floor room with two queen beds. There was plenty of room, the room was clean, there was a frig, coffee maker and micro wave. Great place to travel with young children. Front desk staff was friendly and helpful, housekeeping staff was cheerful and available to help with extra towels, etc. What more could you want from a beach front hotel with the most beautiful winter sunsets off the San Diego coast We wil be back soon!!First, I would like to thank you for taking the time to write this review. I am also glad you enjoyed your stay with us, and of course, your pets are always welcome here. We are one of the few properties that do accept pets and we know many by their names.

"We arrived to check-in at 4pm. The person at the counter did not acknowledge us for 20 minutes while she casually talked to the customer in front. Then when it was our turn, our room was not available (and should have been ready at 3pm). When we arrived back later to settle in for the evening at 9pm, there was again a 10 minute wait at the counter. They gave us a gift bag for our inconvenience. The wine in the gift bag turned out to be rotten or corked. Now this bordered on absurd. The room itself was fine. When I asked to speak to the manager on our way out in the morning the receptionist said that he was not available, but would email me. It was truly a terrible example of customer service.Ms. Sara Z , Let me start this response by apologizing to both of you in regards to the overall experience you had at our hotel, as we can see we failed to meet your basic guest needs. Our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests on Friday Saturday, we failed to provide you with personalized service and attention during your arrival and throughout. We are happy to hear that the upgraded accommodations to our Urban suite was up to your standards. Also regarding the gift bag and wine, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 30 gift bags per day and we have not had this situation happened before, we update our wines every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of the wine during your visit, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience. I am sorry we missed you during your checkout, as our Manager on Duty was available and expecting you. We hope that you would provide us the opportunity to further discuss the details of your stay you can contact me directly at 415.392.8800. We look forward to your response.

I called the front desk and was told - well what would you like me to do. Changing rooms was apparently not an option. I finally attempted to use the shower and the drain didn't work and water flooded all over the bathroom. I then used the incredibly tattered towels to attempt to mop up the bathroom. Someone should have informed me that I was being giving and ADA room...and then imagine if you were in a wheelchair and had to use a flooding bathroom! Disgusting and disappointing.

We have no complaints about the motel-style Wine Valley Lodge. Our room was clean, the 2 Queen sized beds were very comfortable, our mini-fridge and TV worked just fine, and we appreciated the heated outdoor pool and the free daily continental breakfast, served 7am - 10am.

"Checked in here last week for two nights. Booked in advance a two queen bed room for myself, husband, and five year old daughter. Our normal hotel we stay at in Anaheim was sold out already (close to Thanksgiving) so we went with the Del Sol Inn since it's also equally close to the park.And that's the best part. You can walk to the parks in about five minutes even if you just miss the light to cross Harbor Blvd.!When checking in I was greeted the following way: Hi, can I help youYes, I have a reservation, insert name hereOh, I've been dreading you all night.Um, ok...Yeah, we don't have any more two bed rooms, so I have to give you a king with a roll-away, but don't worry, we won't charge you for the roll-away.Really It's only 8pm and I made this reservation months agoSorry.So then we go to park and of course there's no parking. We're assured that Valet is free, but you have to tip.The room is okay. Clean, up to date, AC/Heat worked fine.The roll-away arrives and it's horrible. My five year old refused to sleep on it and I didn't blame her one bit, it was really lumpy in some areas and hard in others, so then we shared a bed for two nights.Free Wifi wasn't consistent, but worked okay about 75 of the time.We didn't try the breakfast.All the hotels in this area have noise issues so I'm not knocking them at all for that.It was nice to have a fridge in the room.That's about it.

"Worst Hotel Experience of My Life!!!!!!!!!! Spent one night there on 1/11/2016. When we checked in, the desk clerk gave us out two room keys cards and told me, in a threatening manner, that if I did not return both key cards upon checkout, I would be charged 3.00. When we arrived at our floor, there was room furniture stacked along the walls of the hallway on both sides. I plan to notify the building inspector about this because I believe it violates fire and safety codes. The phone in the room made buzzing and vibration sounds all night. I finally had to disconnect the phone. Went to take a shower and there was no hot water. When I went to check on my car in the morning, it was parked in by an 18 wheeler. I went to the desk, but they were no help. It took me about 45 minutes to find the driver to ask him to move the truck. He told me that the hotel staff allowed him to park there because he was delivering furniture to the hotel. When were checking out at 10:30 AM, we waited about 15 minutes for the elevator. The delay was due to the hotel staff using the elevator to move new furniture to the upper floors. This would have been OK between 11:30 AM and 3:00PM (after checkout time and before check in time). But the staff in this hotel allowed the move to take place during prime checkout time. I NEVER HAD A SINGLE APOLOGY FROM THE HOTEL STAFF. MOSTLY BLANK STARES. I will never, ever stay at this place again.",WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Room was comfortable, hypo-allergenic pillows were provided upon request, windows open. The lobby is musty and old. There is an adjacent restaurant that is closed during check-in times, partially, with an unimpressive bar. Good beer selection, but this is not a place to hangout or people-watch.

Through online reviews and proximity within the city, we selected the Galleria---and they lived up to the high reviews! It is a beautiful, clean boutique hotel that is close to everything. We never needed a car and it was a pleasure to come back to just hang out in the room. The bed was comfortable, the sheets soft, nice furnished room and frankly it was a cool historic building the old Sutter Hotel. They even offer a really cool afternoon wine get together in the lobby. The best part however, is the staff. They were so warm, friendly and incredibly helpful. Whatever we needed or asked, they addressed with a smile and immediately took care of.

Arrived in our room to find hair in the bathtub and all over the bathroom floor. Reported to the front desk he said he would switch rooms I informed him I didn't have time as we were to be at a game at the stadium by 5P. I asked that it just be cleaned returned to our room at 10:30P to find an attempt to clean was done but not very well. Still hair in the shower curtain that ended up in the tub and the hair on the floor was never cleaned up. Also in the toilet was someone's leftover movement that wasn't cleaned properly as well. The old style elevator was kind of scary as it had us stuck between floors after another person waiting on it kept pushing buttons.,OK stay for what was needed good be better.,3

"This was a first visit but I will be back. I recently reviewed The Palace, and this was such a better experience. A great rate, a great location, staff was very helpful and accommodating. Joel (front manager) checked me in and his level of helpfulness and enthusiasm was impressive for a jaded traveler like me. The property is dated but charming, bed was one of the best I've had in a hotel in a while. Bath situation is a little cramped, street noise can be pretty significant, and food options are pretty limited (sushi only, best as I could tell, though I'm not a big user of room service). But the whole experience was very good and I intend to be go back. One petty note...the staff gave a good push for their Joy of Life Club and since I have stayed at a number of Joie de Vivre properties and liked them all, I decided to sign up. Enrollment was not particularly convenient, and it turns out they will only credit stays booked directly through their web site, yet my employer requires me to book through our corporate travel site...so all that trouble to enroll and I will probably never get any points. If you're going to use a club to encourage repeat visits, it ought to be easy and encouraging, not difficult and overly restrictive.Hello,We truly appreciate your feedback and I am glad that you enjoyed the hotel. We have forwarded your review to Joel as well. By your comments, it seems that our staff may have misinformed you on the types of bookings that can receive points. Any reservation booked directly through the hotel will recieve points. These eligible bookings also include some corporate travel sites that do not utilize a 3rd party prepayment method. We do not award points for 3rd party prepaid reservations such as Expedia, Hotwire, Hotels.com, etc. I am sorry for any confusion this caused. You have received your points for this stay already. If you have stayed at any other JDV properties in the last 30 days or so, I can also award points for those stays. Again, thank you for your positive review on TripAdvisor and your time. If I can be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact me directly. We hope to see you again soon!Warmest regards,Katie SpidellDirector of OperationsGalleria Park Hotel",Loved it,4

"First off, this hotel is about 1 mile from the space needle and Pikes Market. Reading other reviews, I laugh at comments about it's location since you should probably look at a hotel's address in relation to where you are going before you book Free breakfast and Wifi were excellent. Kids watched Netflix nightly which I can't say is possible in every hotel. Pool is dated and heavily chlorinated with cheap stuff that makes your eyes burn. Goggles are a must for the kids. When we booked this hotel, it shows up as a category 7 for rewards which his hilarious (equivalent to Maui) so I used my corporate rate which saved us about 100/night over closer hotels. We had planned on using Uber, but found out that the FREE hotel shuttle would drop/pickup at the Space Needle and Westlake Mall. From Westlake, it's a few more blocks to Pikes Market, but like most Americans I need the exercise :) If you are on vacation and unless you need a car to go outside of downtown/waterfront Seattle, I would advise on ditching it at one of the nearby locations and save the 26/day valet.Free breakfast and Wi-Fi always make for the start of a great stay, especially when youre visiting a city, Mike. Thats why we make sure you can begin each day full and connected. Were also all about providing that free shuttle to take you to those popular Seattle spots. Keep us in mind next time youre in the city!Safe travels,Frank F., General Manager",Nice hotel and shuttle is awesome!,5

"Today with the economy the way it is everyone is trying to make a dollar. That is understandable. My stay at the Suncoast lost its glitter when I was told I had to pay for a boarding pass to be printed. I could not believe that they do not include this courtesy for their guests. A daily charge of 5 was charged to my credit card. The explanation was that includes all local calls, a safe in the room, a small refrigerator and wi-fi. As far as I am concerned the refrigerator could be removed as a inclusion. I had a room that was extremely noisy and asked to be moved. It took them hours to get this accomplished. I refused to gamble there after being told about the charge for the printing of the boarding pass. We had dinner at the Red Rock and I decided to try and see if they would print my pass for me. I didn't think they would do it but I was shocked. They never asked me for money or even if I was staying there at the hotel as a guest. I explained to the desk clerk what had happened and they couldn't believe it. I was told they print lots of boarding passes for people as a courtesy not just guests of their hotel. This finished me with the Suncoast. I will never dtay there again while in Vegas. It's the principle of the thing that matters. They could have gained my respect and lots more business from my office. There is no reason for this to happen. It is not good PR at all. The Red Rock has all of my future business. No wonder the Republicans didn't go to the Suncoast. The Red Rock rolled out the carpet and knows how to treat people.Thank you for your feedback, and your comments. We do apologize your experience was unsatisfactory. I do want you to know we take all comments as an informational tool to help serve our customers in a more efficient way.",Not A Happy Guest,3

"My wife and I stayed here for one night prior to our cruise the following day. I searched the internet for perhaps 2 hours before I found this gem and made a reservation months in advance. We were picked up at the airport by the complimentary shuttle. The wait time was about 40 minutes. The front desk clerk was very pleasant and very accomodating. The check in went smoothly and I was even able to make port transfers at the same time (12 pp).Our room had 2 double beds with adjustable mattresses. The room was very clean and included several pillows for each bed. This hotel has its own restaurant but no complimentary breakfast. However, there is a Dennys and a McDonalds across the street as well as a gas station with a small store where you can get snacks and pop for the cruise ship. There is also a data center with free wifi, an exercise room and a pool w/ hot tub. This hotel also has a plan for storing your car for free while you are on a cruise if you stay only one night. I would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone looking for a stay prior to a cruise.",Great night's stay at a classy hotel,5

"This is a relaxing resort that has enough space to make sure folks are not congested. The new facilities like sky pool and newer buildings/pools are well laid out and prevent congestion in one area. The resort is comfortable and quiet. Food at Bistro and Shen Zao are good. Guests are not snooty. No parties going on here, which is for other resorts, so there is a resort where peace and quiet for the most part exists, thank god!

"The ONLY good thing about this hotel, is the 20minute walk to Arch De Triomphe and Champs lyses. Other than that, lots of other things were not right. The hotel is highly overpriced. Even though rooms are generally small in Paris, thse rooms were REALLY SMALL. The sheets were not changed for 3 days, until we asked. We know it wasn't changed because of the tea stain on the sheets that never went away from the first night. And it seemed like making the bed was all they did, albeit, haphazardly. Sometimes our teacups were not even washed or changed, despite obvious signs of use. Breakfast, you will be told is free, but a cup of tea was 15Euros. You wouldn't know this if you don't read the fine print on your desk when you arrive. So your croissant was free, but the much needed tea on a winter morning would cost you 15Euros. I will be looking somewhere else for a hotel on our next visit to Paris.",Highly overpriced and no hospitality!,2

"Sure, I read the reviews that people wrote before we booked a room.....but I thought, some people just expect too much. I was wrong, I admit it, it definately IS as bad as people say. Oh of course this place will always have a lot of guests because it is so close to Seattle Center (about 2-1/2 blocks). The SPH owner knows this and probably feels he doesn't have to fix anything. Where do I start hmmm.. STAFF: although most are friendly, the early morning staffer is old, grumpy and smells like he hasn't taken a shower in a week. Someone spilled coffee in the breakfast room and he was swearing up a storm. He also was cranky when we complained our card key to our room didn't work. The owner/manager is also not too much of a people person. THE ROOM: our card key never worked very well, usually had to simultaneously wiggle the card back and forth in the slot, and give the door a kick. We had 3 different staff people on each day of our 3-day stay come up and open the room door for us because the key didn't work. The AC unit was behind a curtain (had to place the curtain on a chair to get air flow), was set at 60 degrees and the temperature adjustment button was broken (the room gets VERY hot without AC). The TV is very complicated to operate with a wall switch, two remotes, and a separate power box all needing to be synchronized to get it to work (we had to have a staff person come up to show us how to work it). Extremely bright construction flood lights are on all night outside the room window, so the curtain needs to be tightly closed (see above AC problem making this impossible). BREAKFAST: consists of orange juice, mini-bagels, mini-muffins, and poor coffee...skip breakfast here. The website says that they recently remodeled, but I think it was only the new floor tile in the lobby area because the rest of the place looks like it hasn't been updated since the 1950s. There is currently construction in progress on all sides of the hotel, so walking or driving to and from the parking lot is not the best or convenient. The view from our hotel room window is of the space needle and EMP, which would be great except the view is obscured by construction cranes and cement trucks. They are building a freeway tunnel behind the hotel. If you want to be near downtown, spend a few bucks more and avoid this place. Lowest price is not the best choice in Seattle.First of all, thank you for taking the time to review our property. We constantly try to provide our guests with the best possible service and hospitality, and we're sorry that we didn't meet your needs during your stay. Our policy is to provide great customer service, so we were troubled to hear that our staff was unusually negative towards you. Your concerns have been communicated to the management team to review and address. As far as the construction goes, we're sorry your beautiful view of the Space Needle was obstructed. Unfortunately, this project is out of our control, and we can guarantee that it will improve with the completion of the new tunnel. Finally, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our rooms and make them more comfortable for our guests, so we will take your comments into account. Thank you again for your review, and we hope you'll return to Seattle again soon!","Construction all around, difficult access, minimum comfort rooms, cranky staff.",1

"I stayed here for 2 nights in July 2013.I originally made my booking through the Adelaide Hostel online and requested a private room.When I arrived at the Adelaide Hostel, I was greeted by one of the staff who was outside having a smoke. (The hostel is at the end of a short dirty alleyway with mostly rubbish bins on the street. It smells, looks and feels seedy) Having arrived at 10AM I was super early for the standard 3PM check in for a private room. She guided me across the road to store my bags. I asked her for directions to the closest train station. She fired off street names and intersections at me like I was a local and then went off. Completely useless. I quite literally just flew into San Fran and had told her it was my first time! Not impressed.Having come back at 3PM for check in I was told that the private rooms are a 5 minute walk away at another hotel. The gentleman at reception was really not friendly or helpful. I grabbed my bags and walked uphill with 2 x 23Kg bags to Post street. Crossed over and walked about 1 minute to the Fitzgerald Hotel.The check in staff couldn't didn't my booking but somehow found me a room! 5 minutes of humming and being a bit flustered by the check in girl. I was surprised that I had to pay for my whole stay up-front! Very strange. I was given room 204. Its the room above reception. The elevator is super old and small and smelly and dirty. Moving bags up in this was not easy.The room was clean but super small. The bed was surprisingly comfortable. The decor was circa 1980's B-grade movie style. The bathroom had not been cleaned properly and there were stray hairs all over the place. The bathroom was practical though. Oh, apart from the bathroom door being like a patio door. It was completely see through glass! So when my friend joined me on day 2 for 1 night, one of us had to leave the room so we didn't have to see the other doing the dirty deed! The room was not cheap either. Its USD 140 incl tax per night. This is cheap-ish in San Fran but not in general.The worst part The staff. ALL the staff I spoke with were really unhelpful and it felt like I was being a right royal nuisance every time I asked them something. I wasn't asking stupid questions either - practical questions like the best airport shuttle or the closest good quality diner. The real winner - was when I went down to reception at midnight to ask if someone could replace my in-room phone as it wasn't working and had to call overseas urgently. The guy there was so rude and so abrupt. He actually sighed and threw his laptop when I asked him to check my room phone or permit me to use the lobby phone. When he realized the phone was broken he apologized and let me use the lobby phone.The only good things about this hotel: (1) wifi is quick and reliable. (2) the location is handy to cafes, restaurants and public transport.",Location. Nothing more.,3
"Mediocre resort, the crowds were absurd, (the line for rentals was about 2.5 hours) and by the time we got rentals, they were out of certain sizes of skis and were making substitutions or asking people to wait fo returns. r r The trails, arguably the best part of the resort, only suit intermediate to advanced skiers. Their beginner trails are poorly marked, few and far between, and overly crowded. The advanced trails are too easy for those accustomed to skiing in Colorado. r r ...view moreService wise, the staff is a bit lazy, uninformed, and sometimes downright rude. There were multiple instances of being brushed aside when requesting help and multiple instances of staff members standing idly by while lines formed out the door. r r And suffice to say, the price that they charge is definitely not worth the experience you get. The food, which is understandably overpriced, was not fresh and caused a member of our party to get two days worth of stomach troubles from the cafeteria food. . r r In conclusion, avoid at all costs unless you really have no other choice.

"Good: someone outside of the hotel left a package for me at the front desk. They were nice enough to remember to give it to me when I checked in. Service people were nice and housekeeping did a good job. Bad: A/C kept cutting out after 10-30 minutes. Not having functional A/C in Chico in the middle of July is kind of important... The controls on the unit were relocated for your convenience to the wall near the bathroom. They also must have installed some sort of temperature or time limiter on it. Room got up to 83 before I went to the control unit and changed the fan from high to low in order to jump start the A/C unit again. Queen size bed was really a Full. Towels in bathroom were made for dwarves. Came late for breakfast, but all I saw were danishes, Fruit Loops, Captain Crunch, milk and apples. Better than nothing.",Very disappointed,2

"My wife and I stayed at the Drury on Poydras on Friday night before the Jazz Half Marathon. We had stayed at the Drury before and enjoyed it very much. This time was no different. The hotel is clean and comfortable with a large inviting lobby. The have adopted valet-only parking which at 25 is expensive, but in line with other hotels in the area. The valets were very helpful and the service was excellent. The hotel offers a complimentary evening happy hour and breakfast with rather good food. We had a corner room, which was not a suite, but very spacious with a whirlpool bath. The room was comfortable, quiet, and had a nice view. The Drury is located at the edge of the French Quarter and provides easy access to the major sites. We had the added benefit of being only 1 block from the race start line at Lafayette Square.

"To our surprise the hotel was under a major reintivation, with construction materials everywhere, cluttered throughout, dirty and not well maintained. The pictures of the property on the web did not match what we actually experienced.No security at the hotel, as all of the doors from the parking lot and center courtyard where broken and not using the key pad to enter. Anyone could enter the building. Crushed and broken glasses lined the parking lot on one side of the building. The A/C unit was very old with missing knobs and instructions that were worn off. Getting the room to a comfortable temperature was a challenge. Dirty used towels were hanging in the shower questioning whether the room had been properly cleaned from the prior occupant. Duct tape was used to patch the holes in the curtains. To top that off the mattress was as hard as a rock making sleeping nearly impossible.If it was not for us driving all day and that it was late in the evening we would have not stayed at this hotel. Worst experience at a hotel in my life time. To top it off, we paid way too much for the room based on the experience and status of the property.

They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay.

"The service was wonderful. Always cheerful and very helpful. This is quite important to me. The hotel is nice, but the tv had a very bad picture. It was an off brand. I'm not usually in the room much, so not hat big of a deal to me. If coffee is important in your room, you may want to bring your own or head out, as it's quite awful. Starbucks is almost across the street :) I also had a very difficult time with wifi reception in my room. I did accidentally lock my belongings in the safe without my code entered and they responded almost immediately to assist. Take note, the safe functions completely differently than any others I've ever used. Our friends did the same thing in their room. Valet is quite expensive, 40 per nt., but I'm sure parking is at a premium. We didn't need our car at all during our stay, as so much is within walking distance and there is a good bit of public transportation.

It's not the center, but we got to most places on foot, that took from 15 to 40 minutes (Chinatown, Academy of Science, Piers). Hotel proposes guests free tee-coffee and WI-FI.

For example, when I called the front desk to ask about internet access, they informed me it would be extra, even though I could have sworn it was included in my rate (it was). A key issue is there is absolutely zero cellular reception if you're on ATT. The hotel acknowledges this (obviously not their fault), so if you need blackberry access, forget about it.","Nice rooms, no cellular reception",4

"After being on a 7 day cruise that left out of New Orleans, we decided to stay and explore the beautiful city of New Orleans. We were with a group of friends who were staying at the NOPSI Hotel, so we decided to book a room there too, and boy were we glad we did. This hotel is virtually brand new, opening in July 2017. The NOPSI Hotel building formerly served as the headquarters of the citys power and transportation company, New Orleans Public Service Inc. Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street. Its situated in a perfect location, walking distance from virtually all local attractions. We walked back and forth to Bourbon Street many times during our short stay. On sight parking is available for a fee. You should contact the hotel directly for daily rate charges. Pinot, Thank you for sharing your NOPSI Hotel experience. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. It has been exciting for us to finally share NOPSI with our guests. Whether you are dining at one our restaurants or relaxing in one of our well-appointed rooms, we are here to make your stay memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager",Luxury NOLA Hotel,5
"It is situated right downtown so a pretty tough area.One elevator was broke down-the other had no permit hanging would take 5+ minutes to come if it even came.It creaked and the door would barely close.It would also take you to the basement no matter what button you pushed.We finally used the stairs.The pool is on second level along with an old parking lot room windows(which can open) There would be food broken glass and even broken pieces of the building that you would have to walk through to go to the pool or get in the building(even though those 3 doors were broken and wouldn't let you in with your key) The pool was dirty-DIRTY.There was dirt and mold all around the walking area.The inside wall of the pool was black. The gym had no air at all,a broken treadmill weights 20lbs over. Room was TINY. There was also the smell of marijuana on the 5th floor and partying in resulted in someone pulling the fire alarm at midnight and we had to be evacuated. No one from the front desk ever came to use someone staying here said we could come in. Its not worth the price.You can get a much better hotel at the same rate.

People at the front desk had no clue about anything and were rude. The tram service was fast and efficient. The pool areas were really nice for the kids. But once again the staff was tough to deal with. Everytime we called with a question about something they were rude on the phone and didn't have any answers and would just bounce us around to someone else who didn't know anything. Finally hold on to your wallet when you are preparing to leave. They hit you with resort fees that aren't disclosed and its per day plus tax on each fee. And also I made a 44 second phone call and next to the phone it says it would be 2.00 a min. Well when the check out bill came they hit me with a 15 connection fee on top of it. totaling about 20 for less than a minute on the phone. called the customer service desk and the lady flat out lied saying it was disclosed on the card next to the phone. What is this the 1920's I think that was another lie about the att connection fee. Then she said well we can't disclose it because att changes the rate all the time.

Las habitaciones muy buenas, aunque no lujosas, pero si por encima de las basicas de otros hoteles. al centro son 10 estaciones, no hay pierde pues es la ultima parada de una linea corta. aprox. 40 minutos. el desayuno bueno. En general volveria sin pensarlo y lo recomiendo. No te hacen ningun cargo extra.Si llegas despues de las 10:30 puedes tomar taxi muy facilmente, siempre hay 10 o 20 afuera y te cobran aprox. 10 dolares. A diferencia de otros hoteles un poco mas lujosos se caracterizan por ser muy amables y comprensivos. al frente hay toda clase de restaurantes, supermercados y algunos comercios",todo bien,4

The room was very hot and a little noisy (road noise, and directly below restaurant). Dcor was fine but a little battered in places (bar decoration still underway).

"Located right in the heart of Old Town, the Best Western Hacienda is walking distance to all the shops and restaurants in Old Town. That means you'll have no problems with the 32oz. margaritas.Rooms are spacious and well-furnished with microwave, coffee machine, hair dryer and safe. The gym is also well-equipped with high quality treadmills and exercise bikes and a universal machine. There are no free weights but there is free bottled water and towels.The breakfast buffet was good but may not be included if you book through a third party site. The hotel is built on a hillside and some of the upper level rooms require some stair climbing. If you wish to avoid that, be sure to ask for a lower level room. Parking is somewhat limited. There is a covered lot that charges a fee for overnight parking or you can choose to park in the free lot on the corner. There are perhaps 20 to 25 spaces in the free lot so plan accordingly.Greetings, and thank you for the excellent, and humorous review!

"My wife and I stayed here while visiting the Del Mar Fairgrounds. My wife liked it a lot, but I had some hesitations. The room did not have a mini-refrigerator which I thought all Hampton Inns had. If you are expecting a mini-frig, be sure and request it when making your reservations. The furniture and room colors were drab and boring, and could use upgrading or wall paper. The beds were very good. The flat screen t.v. was nice, but no HD channels, and in fact, only about a dozen channels. Could use Discovery and Fox Sports San Diego. The breakfast room downstairs is very big with a good breakfast, (although I would have liked some donuts or something sweet!). I thought the towels were very thin, and could use upgrading. There were no flyers/brochures of local attractions like all hotels have now days. I thought the Hampton Inn-Kearney Mesa was better. But, this hotel was VERY QUIET, considering all the people staying there during the fair! That was a major plus.","Very quiet, but details not as nice as other Hampton Inns",3

"And they were deceived.... We picked the Mandarin in Miami because we had a great experience in Singapore and because of the impression of quiet and cosiness. Overall, it is a Mandarin, but nothing like what we have experienced elsewhere. Cleanliness and staff service are very high quality. Our room was upgraded, but it was nothing exceptional, so I wonder what a standard room is like. They have a very convenient dock for connecting to the audio-video system, and the bathroom is great. But there is limited space for storing luggage in the room, so it get crammed if you have more than two pieces. It is also surprising that in an international hotel chain, plugs are US standard only and they don't have the multi-system plugs... But the biggest deceptions are the following: 1 - The website indicates there's a private beach, well it's just some sand with long chairs. Don't think you can swim and enjoy a relaxing retreat.2 - Breakfast buffet is only cold cuts, cheese, fruits and cereals. It's a small, sad table compared to the extravaganza of other Mandarins. 3 - Internet is not complimentary, and it is quite expensive too, 15/day. All in all, we were so disappointed with our stay that we decided to cut it short and spend only one night there. The Mandarin is still an interesting hotel to stay at, perhaps with more realistic expectations you wouldn't be disappointed. This is a good hotel for business travelers, as it is very close to the financial district and there's not a grocery store around if you wanted to buy anything.",And they were deceived....

I can't say enough about the staff and how accommodating they are for their guests. The consistently go above and beyond.

"This hotel was a bit on the older side but was clean and comfortable and a decent value for the price I paid. It's located along a decently-sized and safe shopping/dining corridor, and I was pleasantly surprised that Starbucks is right across the street. Note: I reserved and paid in full through hotels.com but was asked for my credit card upon check-in, and an additional 75 hold was applied to my account and remained for one week...which seemed a little excessive to me, given that I was there for barely 12 hours. Maybe a week-long hold of 150 of the nightly room rate is standard for most hotels, and I've just never noticed before, but budget-conscious visitors might want to be aware of this. I was also charged a 10 pet fee, which wasn't advertised here, but that wasn't a huge deal. (The hold, by the way, was NOT pet-related, it was a general damage deposit that they charge to ALL guests.)","Good value for the $, but beware of hidden fees.",4

On the minus side, the shower seemed to have two temps, really hot and even hotter and while the sink fixtures seemed stable, the hardware parts unseen shuddered every time I turned the water on.Breakfast: plentiful, chobani yogurts.

"I was disappointed with the dingy appearance of the hotel, and the lobby smelled strongly of curry. The room was dingy, as well. In the middle of the night the smoke detector started beeping a low battery beep. They came and changed it and it was fine. The air conditioner was noisy, even on low. Their breakfast was lacking as well. If you like waffles and coffee or juice it would be good. The only thing it had going for it was, it was close to where I needed to go and was not expensive.",Hotel was close to where I needed to be.,2
Great location. Front desk staff very accommodating. Will go back.,Very convenient.,5
"Decided to do a quick SF downtown get away and this hotel was in a perfect location - walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown and North Beach. If you need to visit the wharf, hop on public transit a few blocks down. Gallerias room is small but very quaint and have been updated so one doesn't feel claustrophobic ! We had the queen bed and it was just right for a night - travel light - not a lot of floor space but they do have a small closet for your luggages. Rooms are small but it didn't bother us- bed linens were comfortable that's what matters. The property also has a third floor which opens up to a garden and small running track if you need to stretch your legs ! The reservation agent provided us with a pretty good deal so I couldn't turn it down - nice boutique hotel in the heart of the city. Wifi- free the first night ONLYParking- 49 a night with in and out privilegesFree wine reception in the evenings from 4-6pm in the lobby.Will come back since they gave us 15 off for the next booking.Dear MillieWT,Thank you so much for the five-star review!!We are all pleased that your recent stay at Galleria Park went well enough that you plan to return in the future! The location is a wonderful draw to those looking for a city getaway for the weekend as you are able to access all of San Francisco without a car thanks to public transit. The Garden Terrace is a huge hit with our guests because it is very unique to have a green space in the center of a city (especially on the 3rd floor of a hotel!) Having a garage of our own is great, as it allows us to offer the valet service that is important to a number of our guests who need access to their car throughout their stay.We look forward to your return visit in the future!Sincerely,Jordan Whitney",Perfect location for downtown SF,5

"The renovations in my room were very inconsistent. On the positive side, the living area and the bed room were nicely updated with modern furniture, quality curtains, and a very comfortable bed. But, the kitchenette and bathroom looked as though they hadn't been updated in decades. The cabinet doors were hanging askew, the bathroom door was in desperate need of paint, and the tub was old, stained, and yellowed. Also, I had a remote control that didn't work, a lamp that didn't work, and a drain that stopped up and spilled water into the floor. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again.",Would not stay here again,3

"Ut fra det vi hadde lest om hotellet i beskrivelse og kundekommentarer ble vi meget skuffet. Det var langt fra noe juniorsuite, men en stor rom. Badet var ikke avfotografert og vi var derfor skeptiske, men uten grunn. Dette var ok.Det var beskrevet 2 svmmebasseng og barnebasseng (svmmebasseng var en forutsetning for oss da vi bestilte). Det var et basseng som ikke hadde/hadde anledning til solsenger og l delvis i skyggen pga trr/palmer. Fotoet fra hotellet viste feil. S godt som ingen gjester brukte det ene bassenget. Takterrassen var meget bra. Nr vei til en flott strand og et koselig sentrum. Det var ogs beskrevet at hotellet kunne hente bringe fra/til flyplassen (dette sjekket vi p mail til hotellet fr vi reiste). De kunne bestille taxi... Beskrevet gratis avis. Ja - i respesjonen. Klimanlegget var fast stilt p 19 gr.C. Ble ppekt 2 ganger fra oss uten bli ordnet. Samme tannglass - uten bli vasket - i 14 dager.. Det sparatet sitteomrdet var 2 stoler p rommet, ved sengen.. Kjleskapet p rommet var varmt. Vi fikk beskjed om at det skulle vre slik, men at vi mtte sette inn noe kaldt, s ville det bli bra. Det stemte ikke...Dessverre kommer vi ikke til reise tilbake. Vi anbefaler Hotels.com justere beskrivelsen. Med andre forventninger kunne nok oppholdet blitt greit.",Tilfredsstilte ikke forventningene.,3
"This hotel is in a great location especially if you are here with the family. It is across the freeway from mission bay park where there are places to play and relax. The hotel room was very clean but in serious need of an update. This is a reasonably priced hotel for the area. Parking is free and there is a great selection for the included breakfast. We have stayed at another resort hotel in San Diego and were charged for parking per day and resort fees per day and the resort room was not that much nicer so in comparison this place was a steal. My only complaints would be the noise. We were on the first floor and could hear everything going on in the parking lot. It was pretty quiet at night so getting a good night sleep wasnt an issue. I would stay here again, hopefully next time the rooms are updated. Thank you very much for the review. We do have a renovation that may start during the Fall. Very sorry for the noise pollution.",Clean hotel in a good location,4

"Very recently we were looking for a hotel near the Orlando Convention Center without having to pay an arm an a leg. We found the Comfort Inn Suites Universal at a very reasonable price and looked for reviews. As always, there were some good ones and some bad ones. We took the chance and we got the surprise of our life.As soon as we arrive, we knew we had made the right choice.Checking-in was like a breeze. We have heard that the higher floors were quieter and had a better view and even though we have already a room assigned, the reception person (Neil), gave us a room even closer to the corner.The room was not only attractive, but huge and very clean. 2 very were comfortable queen beds plus an area with a sofa-bed and a table.The location is great for the price. 1.5 km (1 mile) from the Convention Center, one block from International Drive, close to all kind of restaurants and stores.Breakfast (between 6.30 and 10 am) could be a little better. It's not bad, but every morning they have the same items.By far the highlight of this hotel is the staff. They'll go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy your stay. Kudos to Neil, Fuse and Orlando in the reception desk (if you need information, talk to them) and to the cleaning ladies which were always smiling and doing an excellent job. One morning we even saw the Manager (Alberto) cleaning the floor at the entrance of the elevators after a careless guest coming from breakfast, spilled some liquid and didn't do anything about it.The only down side is that the hotel receives large groups or tourists, and if one of these groups is having breakfast, you may be for a long wait.Like most Comfort Inn in the world, the service is superb. If you forgot any toiletry, all you have to do is ask for it.By far, one of the best hotel in the area for the price.We are going back to Orlando very soon, and we'll go back to the Comfort Inn Suites Universal ...... for more friendly and excellent service.CONGRATULATIONS!Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review about your stay with us. It is so nice of you to recognize our wonderful staff. I will share your comments with all of them. We are looking forward to having you as our guest again in the near future.","No nonsense, good quality and excellent service!",4
"My husband surprised me with a trip to Chicago to see Andrea Bocelli in concert, and we stayed here because it was near to the concert venue. The hotel was very nice and the room was comfortable, bed soft. We did not spend much time here, but there was a nice hotel bar and event center. It is close to the airport and the area in which it is located is not the prettiest, although it is just 5 minutes away from the Oak Park area which is beautiful.",Nice stay,4

"The stay was for business and the room booked through my office. It was prepaid through Expedia. The room was FILTHY!!! Stains, burn marks, bugs, and it smelled terribly of smoke (booked a non-smoking room). The bathroom was extremely dirty and there was no way I could shower in it. One light in the room worked, all others did not. I video taped it because I had never experienced anything like this. I immediately went back to the manager and expressed my concern. He would not give me a refund so I told him I would take it up with my office and their credit card company. There was no way I was going to stay there. I drove home 2 hours and had to drive back the next day for my business event. It was that bad and I refused to stay there.",DONT EVER STAY HERE!!!,1
"I will never stay here again and its a shame because the facility and location were very nice. I booked and paid in full via Hotels.com. When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning. The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but its a shame the desk staff doesn't have a clue, I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well.",Wont stay here again and its a shame,2
"The front desk reception was friendly and very helpful in directing me to the hote and with my room assignment. The downside was when I requested a room change and was assigned to a room that appeared to have not been thoroughly cleaned. By this time, the shift had changed along with the customer service of the new person behind the front desk, who seemed to be very curt at a simple request for a tooth brush. The upside is that the breakfast was good, as was the service of the very courteous person who went out of her way to assure that everyone was taken care of.",A Nice Stay....,3
"Stayed there for the first time a month ago, wasn't horrible.Tried another stay, this time I couldn't wait to check out, I would have found another place but I was too tired to even look.There was a heavy odor of mold in the room, my sheets were stained with something that was yellow, brown, and red, cigarette burns on the sheets, no pillow cases on on my pillows or at the front desk.

"Location, location, location. This is the main reason this hotel stays in business. We had the best vacation in our 8 days in Orlando, and the hotel room was the only thing that did not work out for us. The price was low, and we got what we paid for.We were recommended this hotel by a travel agent based in Orlando, who told us that the Days Inn we were looking at was disgusting. We did not expect the Ritz, but the photos on the hotel website are at least 15 years old and taken from the best possible angles. It is in a great location, it took us 21 minutes to walk to Universal, and it is a beautiful walk with wide sidewalks the whole way.At check in we were assigned room 211. When we entered, the carpets had wet spots, and smelled like urine. The front desk immediately gave us a key for a room on the third floor. This room did not smell, and we did stay in it. It was not clean enough for our standards, so we purchased cleaner and paper towels and spent an hour cleaning the bathroom and vanity ourselves. Toilet ran- had to giggle the handle every time to stop water flow. Shower was moldy, pipes were loud, and pressure/temperature would vary greatly during your shower.The bed sheets are too small for the bed, and completely threadbare. At least they seemed clean. The bath towels were rough and the size of large hand towels. We had 5 people in the room, but most days got only 3 towels and had to ask for more at the front desk. Rugs were nasty- we kept on our shoes in the room. Only one door key was assigned, and the plastic key would get stuck in the lock every time.On the positive side, the kids loved the pool, and it was cleaned daily. The pool area is a bit old, and the chairs are cheap, but the pool bar is adequate and serves decent food. You can use your laptop near the pool. Pool towels are available at the front desk if you ask for them- but they do not let anyone know this, and most of the other families were using their bath towels.Breakfast was spartan, none of the fruit or muffins they show on the website. Bread for toast, milk, OJ, and frosted flakes were the only options for the kids. Coffee was TERRIBLE. There is an IHOP within a block and about 20 breakfast buffets within 1 mile- use them if you want a good breakfast.From this location you can walk to so many restaurants, and can catch a bus to anywhere in Orlando. Try eating O'Charleys on Turkey Lake Road (1 mile away). They had great food and prices. Lots of great spots for ice cream nearby.Our family is planning to return to Orlando in 2011 and have found much, much nicer properties for only a slightly higher cost. Look at the trip advisor ratings and try to find a higher rated hotel. It's worth the extra cost, especially with the low rates that hotels charge in Orlando.Good luck, and enjoy your time in this spectacular city!",Low Point of our AWESOME Orlando Vacation.

"Just like the other reviews: parking isn't convenient, sliding bslcony door almost impossible to open and close from the outside, and cleaning was spotty. One day the housekeeping didn't arrive until 5:00 p.m., which is hard to plan around as far as showering and getting ready for dinner out. Breakfast was plentiful, with many options. The hot food choices were delicious. Reserved a suite and the extra space came in handy. The location is great, but the festival 3 blocks down could be heard until midnight or later.

"We stayed here for 4 nights. We arrived via the BART train from the airport. The hotel is only a couple of minutes from the nearest train stop. The room size was fine, the bathroom was very nice. The room had a coffee machine but you can also get a free cup of coffee every morning ( great decaf) . We did not eat in the restaurant but instead ate at Lori's Diner ( turn left out of the hotel and it's a few blocks up on the right. Really good breakfasts) . The wine hour was a really good idea, we met some lovely people through this. The whole hotel is very clean, the staff are helpful and it felt like a little oasis of calm in the city. It is well placed for Union square and the trams. Just a note on the trams, we stayed 4 nights and never got on them, the queues were really long. We got taxis to fisherman's wharf for about 15 dollars. Some people have commented on the noise, yes the dustbin men do turn up about 3pm, and you hear the police sirens etc, but if you stay in a city you have to expect noise. They do have some rooms that have internal windows which are quieter . I think these are only doubles , as there were three of us we had a room facing a side road. You could still hear everything outside though. There was not any noise from other rooms or from people walking in the corridors. The beds were very comfy, with lovely pillows. We would defiantly stay here again. Thank you Galleria Park for making our stay a happy one .",Lovely boutique hotel,5

"Where can I start. We stayed here for 6 nights to have a grandson attend a course at Emory U. Good location not too far from the school, restaurants nearby and close to downtown Atlanta, but the place was a real dump!! The carpet was terribly stained. The kitchen old and outdated and we had to ask for pots/pans and after multiple requests they arrived the next day. There were only paper products, even though there was a dishwasher. After several requests, real dishes were supplied. Then when I went to use the dishwasher there was about 2 of brown water on the bottom. Ugh! No one every came up to fix this our entire stay. No cooking for us in this kitchen. Since we were here for an extended time I needed to use the laundry. Only 1 washing machine worked out of 2 and the dryers were old and rusty and the clothes were snagged on the cracked drum. Only used them out of desperation. There were 3 of us staying here and i had to ask for 3 sets of towels daily (only 2 were supplied) when we got home and were told towels were not available since they were washing towels at this time and would leave 3 sets the next day. One of us showered daily using a hand towel. Each day the situation repeated. When I was packing to leave a cockroach scampered across the floor. if I had seen this earlier in our stay we would have definitely left immediately. Do not stay here!! Management is pitiful!!Thank you for your review. I apologize that we failed to meet your expectations on your recent stay with us.

The stay was overall good. The air condition in the rooms are motion-controlled or something. No matter where you set the thermostat. It never gets any colder. They were going to send somebody after maintenance to look at it. But it was 3 in the morning when we went to bed. Didn't want somebody in my room that late. The casino needs new chairs the ones they have are very uncomfortable. Trying to sit at a table for hours upon hours is hard to do. The bathrooms in the casino are located at each end makes it hard to get up and go to the bathroom from a table. Since the tables are in the middle of the casino. Poor design for bathrooms. But drinks were great my drink was never empty playing on the tables or at the slot machines. Which is extremely nice. Everybody was very friendly for the most part. I will stay again.,Great stay!

The only reason why it doesn't get a 5.0 rating is the ambience, which I found a little sterile.It is a LEED-certified hotel, which means it follows environmentally-friendly practices in its energy management and overall business practices. If this is important to you you should stay here. You will not be disappointed by the quality of the experience.The rooftop garden is very nice although I wish it had a bar. You can bring your own up there and we did and enjoyed it. I'm surprised more people weren't up there. The location is excellent, northeast of Union Square makes it even more walkable to North Beach and the waterfront as well as Chinatown (next door).The room was very clean, excellent and very comfortable bed. Didn't eat in the restaurant so I can't comment on it. Breakfast was included in the rate and was good if not spectacular.

"Free coffee refills and budget rates make this motel tops with highway travelers. In ShortThe first Super 8 opened in Aberdeen, S.D., in 1974, charging 8.88 a night. Today, the national franchise, with its familiar red-and-yellow sign, still stands for dependable rooms at wallet-friendly prices. A staple for road-tripping families, truck drivers and tour groups, the motel offers complimentary morning coffee and continental breakfasts.

Just handed us our room keys and told is the number. When we entered through the side door a little later, we found the door propped open with a piece of wood. This did not make us feel safe. Our room did not have a coffee pot, as stated on a sign in the lobby. When we entered the lobby to check out, the clerk was sitting in the lobby chairs, watching TV. We thought he was a patron and wondered where the clerk was. The continental breakfast included some cereal and a quarter loaf of bread. This was at 6:15am.",Hotel reeks of smoke,2
"We had a single king size bedroom.  It was quite large with many places to sit as well as a large bathroom.  Everything was in good shape considering the age of the hotel.  The bed was very comfortable as my back was aching when I got to the room from the drive.  The hotel has a restaurant inside.  Prices were typical of a fancier place $12 for sandwich with side $15-25 for an entry.  I went to get food shortly after I arrived at the hotel and found a 10% off coupon for the restaurant and two free drink coupons on top of the two free breakfast coupons which we used the next day.  My wife and I slept well for the first time in a long time as we didn't have the kids with us.  Breakfast in the morning was different.  They only open up half of the restaurant and you had to wait to be seated.  Our wait was about 15 minutes, a couple with their two kids must have waited nearly 25-30 minutes to get a seat.  And this was for a buffet style breakfast.  I am use to a more sit yourself and help yourself approach.  Maybe this way they can take special orders for guests that don't want the normal buffet.  It seemed a little backwards as breakfast ended at 10:30 AM checkout was at 11:00 AM so if you didn't know you were going to have to wait that long you might miss out.  Other than that we had a good time.  The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again.",Got the job done for a reasonable price.,4

Check-in was prompt and courteous and despite what other reviews may indicate the shuttle to and from the airport was hassle free and not overly time consuming, 15 mins at most. We dined at the restaurant and the food and service was exceptional and not overly priced for an airport hotel. The room was comfortable and quiet and the in-room coffee is always appreciated. The fitness facilites were clean and provided anything you may have forgotten offered more than a few treadmills and ellipticals like most hotels - provided both free weights and machines.

Yes, there were renovations going on, but no noise until 8am. Maybe a problem if you are out partying to 2 am...but I wanted to enjoy the sights, so it was not any inconvenience. The croissant delivered to my door every morning was HUGE, and wonderfully flaky. The staff was helpful with directions and letting me know what areas were safe to walk in. The beds were very comfortable and I slept well each night. The microwave and mini fridge in the room are very handy amenities to have. I am diabetic, and having the fridge/ micro make life much easier when traveling. The worst thing about my trip was a Boil water alert was called (it happens once in a while in this area) but the hotel handed out bottled water to the guests until the area wide situation was resolved.

The show provided a shuttle from the hotel entrance right to McCormick place, so that is a big bonus, as I DO NOT like to drive around Chicago anywhere NEAR morning or afternoon rush. The valets were very nice and quick with your car, but 45 per night for parking seems way overpriced. This alone would cause me to look elsewhere, if I were personally paying for a stay. The Taylor street restaurants were many and varied, Within walking distance (few blocks) had a few decent meals there, but nothing to rave about. This area is a little too close to (actually considered) the west side for my taste. While jogging a few miles, it it easy to see the areas that you should not venture into, simply turn around and head back towards the university.

"My husband stays here so regularly the hotel is practically his second home but it was great for me to come and experience it too. We have Executive club access so that always makes a stay very enjoyable and the staff in the lounge were particularly helpful. The hotel has recently been refurbished and while still very Marriott in style is has more personal touchs that I have seen in other properties. Big plus points are the location, loads of great restaurants in easy walking distance, wonderful friendly helpful staff at all levels and a new thing was the little market shop by reception which was fantastic, not only the sweets etc that you would expect but drawers of everything from new shirts and ties to aspirin etc plus although pricey not unreasonable - my 4 headache pills were 3 but a necessity at the time. The only reason I am not giving the hotel and excellent is the very long wait for room service on Sunday night, Our pizza took forever to arrive and we had 2 or 3 phone calls to see if it was there or not which didn't inspire confidence that it was ever coming!",Great staff and fabulous views,4
I will never never go back to this hotel again.,Pass on this hotel if you want a quiet night,1
"I was in New Orleans for a conference, and stayed an extra two nights to hang with my brother and tour the city. We shared a double Queen room, and were happy it room was more spacious than we expected. Very comfortable and we didn't feel cramped at all. The amenities were comparable to what we'd expect from a nice hotel. And the breakfast was tasty and healthy enough to keep us going all morning long. The location was easy to walk to the French Quarter (we're good walkers), and we found some places to eat nearby when we were too tired to go farther away. My only complaint is that the guys handling our luggage storage were abysmally slow. We had to wait up to 15 minutes to have someone get our luggage out of storage. Other than that, the staff were great and very friendly.","Great value, great location, comfy rooms",4

I had to deodorize the room due to a strange odor, it wasn't horrible but unpleasant. The bed was not comfortable, but was semi-clean other than a well worn sheet. The AC did work very well and the the TV was a recent upgrade, too bad the hotel only had 5 channels to choose from. Overall, I was disappointed with the room and I am thankful I only stayed a single night. I would not stay there again and probably would not stay in a hotel in the surrounding area either.",Not that great,2

"When searching for hotels in Vegas, there are LOADS of options. I knew my boyfriend and I were not going to be in the hotel very long, so I didn't expect 5 star, but I didn't want a 1 star dirty Motel 6 either. I chose this hotel because 70 for a deluxe king sounded great. Photos looked great and looked modern. We arrived at the hotel around 10pm, and waited in line for 15 minutes to check in. Upon checking in, the lady at the desk said they had no king beds available, as booked, but only 2 double beds. Fine. When we got in the room... one of the lamps was unplugged, and we shortly discovered the only way to turn the lamp on and off is by plugging/unplugging it. The 2 double beds had 2 small square pillows each... definitely had to double them, and use 2 each. Horrible view, onto a roof with some AC unit type things. windows did not open, however there were handles and some cracked caulk on it.",Okay...,3

We decided to just stay where we were and my husband managed ok. It was just that the clerk was so certain that he had given us a walk in shower.

"I took my sister to NOLA for her 30th birthday in early November and we stayed at The French Market Inn for three nights. I booked the hotel based on the price which turned out to be exceptional for the location. What I didn't realize was that the hotel staff would be one of the highlights of our trip!Throughout our time at the hotel, Nancy, one of the lovely women working the front desk, made us feel so incredibly warm and welcome. There was a small glitch in their computers when we checked in, and she managed to check us in to our rooms while their computers were fixed so we wouldn't wait in the lobby. She gave us great information on where to eat, where to get on the St. Charles trolley, and even got us a discount on a swamp airboat tour! She was so sweet, she even called the embarassing sunburn myself and my sister got in the swamp a sun tan. Nancy is by far the biggest reason why I would stay at the hotel again.The actual hotel interior and our room were very lovely. The lobby was bright and cheerful and clean, with big comfortable chairs to rest in. Our room was almost like an apartment with two separate sections, super comfortable queen beds, and a pretty nifty shower in the bathroom. It was all very elegant and decorated beautifully. We didn't spend much time outside in the garden area, but it looked very cute. The pool looked clean and there were little wrought iron chairs and tables to sit at. We often saw people drinking coffee in the morning out there.The location was PERFECT. We were within walking distance of literally everything we wanted to do. The actual street the hotel is on is relatively quiet so you can leave all the noise of Bourbon Street behind when it's time to sleep. This location is perfect for the person who wants to be centrally located to all the awesome shops, restaurants, and nightlife, but still have a relaxing place to come back to.The only drawback I could see for some people is that the building is rather old, and therefore, the walls are pretty thin. One morning, we heard someone above us snoring off their hangover pretty heavily. It was really funny to us, but I could imagine it getting on some people's nerves. However, I don't think people go to New Orleans to stay in their hotel room, so I wouldn't let it be much of a deterrent. Overall, lovely place with an even lovelier staff. I will absolutely stay again when I come back.","Wonderful staff, great location, would absolutely stay again!",5

"I have to say this hotel more than fit the bill for my five night stay in Phoenix. The valets were always very helpful and prompt (one of them was a hoot). The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Two of the ladies (one in the morning and one in the evening) always asked about my day and were impressed with everything I had been to see. My room was spacious and the bathroom was a bit strange in its layout (sink extends from outside into the shower area), but it grew on me. They gave me plenty of pillows and the bed was comfy My only issue is that the walls are a little thin (or it could have been the connecting doors), cause I could hear my neighbors very clearly a few times. The hotel is located right near US-10 and is in walking distance of the Phoenix Art Museum and the northern part of downtown. Sad to leave but overall a great stay.Hi jehenson81!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I'll definitely share you accolades with the rest of the team.

"This hotel recently went through an update in regards to the furniture and televisions. I have to say that they did a great job. They didn't. however, replace the tile in the bathrooms to match the rest of the updates, which is a shame. The tub and pedestal sink looked new, but the toilet did not. But I have to say, that the bathroom was the cleanest I have ever seen. Not even one stray hair on the floor! The kitchen also skipped the update, but it was still nice to have a fridge, microwave and stove. All the essential items like utensils, dinnerware and cookware were stocked in the cabinets. Also, there is no wi-fi in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby. There is only a plug for high speed internet located in the room. The hotel is a great bargain for staying near D.C. and I would stay there in a heartbeat.","Updates are great, but somethings were skipped",4

There was live jazz on Friday night and we discovered that about 2/3 the people in the bar were locals - who are quite friendly.

"We stayed at the Monticello Inn for Labor Day weekend. We were 2 couples each with our own room. Upon arrival we were promptly attended to and checked in quickly. Vallet took our vehicle and we headed up to our room. The street it is located on is (Ellis) runs into Powell which is the main street the Trolleys run up and down. This hotel is located in Union Square, your really are in the middle of a great shopping center! Each side you walk you've got shops Adidas, Puma, Bloomingdale's, etc etc! A+ for Location!Once we entered our room, the only negative thing about this whole expreience was the smell of Freshly baked Subway Bread! Ha ha, I believe because of the way the hotel is built the center subway is one level with it's vents on there roof, there roof is also the first floor of the 5 story or so hotel, so it vents into the shaft of sorts and straight into your a/c unit. Big woop! Seeing as we don't like to hibernate in our room when this city is alive, it didn't bother us one bit, except when you woke up in the morning crazy a sandwhich (he he). We reserved a one Bedroom Suite. Upon entering it we were surprised to see how roomy it was. You first enter a living room with a miniature refrigerator, big enough to fit a 2-liter and some can drinks. The Tv is a good sized tv, everything is clean and neat. The couch is comfy as well as the Chair. They have these gorgeous Bay windows with seats built all around it so you can absorb the light if you so choose, cause there isn't much of a view! The bedroom is completley seperate from the living room, there is a door that divides it ( not too common with suites) The decor is exactly as it appears on the website, the stripes look overbearing at first but they are not I assure you! The bed was very comfterble, the sheets where clean. It was very pleasant. The bathroom had a Shower tub Combo, clean as well, no rust or grime build up. This room was a perfect gathering space for us and our friends, seeing as they had gotten a standard room I did look at it and it was very spacious as well.

It started at 8 and my bfs and I got there about 8:45 there was only 1 gal of milk in there sitting out on the counter but there was about 1/2 a cup left. There was no other milk anywhere so that meant no cereal. There was a couple Rice Krispies in a container and a few butter Danish that were broken but that's it. Basically we each ended up with a cup or juice. There wasn't stuff to make the oatmeal that was on the counter either. So breakfast sucked but the room was great.,Excellent budget motel,3
"The Grand Hyatt Seattle is a great place to stay when visiting Seattle. The light rail goes from the airport to west lake station, just 2 blocks from the hotel. Given Seattle's terrible highway traffic, having a hotel that can be easily reached for a fee of 3.00 on the light rail is a huge plus. The hotel is within easy walking distance of all of the tourist sites, museums, cruise ship and ferry docks, as well as many bars and restaurants. If you are planning on spending all of your time in downtown, you will not need a car if you stay here. If you decide to venture out of the city, there is a Hertz car rental office located in the hotel parking garage. The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern. The staff is very helpful and eager to make sure that your stay is stress free. If it happens to be raining, be sure to ask the front desk for an umbrella. They provide complementary sturdy and large umbrellas for guest use. We asked for a room with a view of the water.

We stayed in a 2room suite for 3 nights in April. The beds are extremely comfortable and the rooms are so sound proof that we slept great. The bathroom are beautifully updated with a tub and walkin shower. A plus is the hot breakfast included in the ratted and the 5:30-7:00pm kick back with free drinks and apps. Easy walk to the French quarter and there is a trolley stop right in front of hotel.,Great Value and excellent location,5

"The absolute BEST location for a downtown Seattle hotel just steps from the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pacific Science Centre, etc.. Fully equipped kitchen in the suite and LOTS of space -- larger than most one-bedroom apartments! Excellent buffet breakfast setup with top-notch food quality and very comfortable seating with views of the Space Needle, etc. The rooftop deck has lots of comfortable seating and fire pits etc,, so a wonderful place to wind down and end your day. Too bad the parking stalls are extremely tight limited however, it's to be expected for such a prime downtown location. We will be back for sure!877tiffanyl,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of the kitchen facilities in the room, complimentary breakfast spread in the morning and rooftop terrace. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge",BEST location in downtown Seattle,5
"This hotel is in the perfect location close to the French Quarter - but, far enough from Bourbon to not hear the whooping and hollering. I can't say enough about the staff - they were warm, knowledgeable and super helpful.

"What you get for the price is a steal of a deal. The decorations are very unique classy so I loved it visually. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They keep the grounds very clean and up to date. The rooms, are small, but that didn't bother me as I wasn't there to spend time in my room. The bathroom was beautiful and very clean, yet again, small. The walls are thin, so if anyone talks loudly, you can hear them. I loved that the offer complimentary wine every evening, with generous portions. I would go back because location, cleanliness and staff, it was well worth the price I paid.

I didn't realize it was a motel when I booked the stay. So it wasn't the best when we arrived during a blizzard.

"We've stayed at the JW Marriott Buckhead every year for the past 3 years, with our most recent stay December 2015. I must begin by saying that this is one of the cleanest hotel properties I've ever visited, and I travel quite frequently (approximately every 2 months). Not only is the service great, but everything from the lobby to Nox Creek and the guest rooms look and feel absolutely beautiful. Hotel aesthetics aside, the property itself is conveniently located in the middle of Buckhead, directly connected to Lenox Square Mall. Moreover, there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance that are outside of the mall. If you don't feel like walking or if the weather doesn't permit, one of the hotel's cars will take you to almost any restaurant within 2 miles of the property. I will most definitely return this year for our annual trip to ATL.",Always Wonderful,5

"The hotel is in the tourist part of town and walking distance to Morro Rock, which we wanted. There are many other similar hotels nearby. They're beach-funky rather than glamorous, and we've stayed in others. The staff here was great. We were very pleased with the complimentary breakfast, and the hot tub. The room had a few problems which I alerted them to. We had party-noisy neighbors on one side, and I had to call the desk about them one night. I heard the neighbor receive the call and they quieted down. The hotel was getting a face lift while we were there. The weirdest thing was that all the rooms' bathroom windows face the hallway outside the rooms. But overall we had a good experience.",It Worked For Us,4

"We stayed 2 nights: New Year's Eve and New year's day, and the location was ideal in the heart of Union Square. Saks 5th Ave is a few blocks away, Japantown is a brisk 15 minute walk...Friendly hotel staff, valet parking (35/night) The hotel is a quirky older building (not a bad thing), with dead-end corridors ending at full-height windows looking out onto the street, glass walls looking down into restaurant/common areas. Personality Hotel Group has added a modern sleek look to the whole place. Blue elevator buttons, stainless headboard that peels away to reveal the wall, Artemide night table swing arm lamps, simple modern shower fixtures all add to the industrial chic. The shower was strong, room had complimentary wireless, filing drawer dresser, writing desk, Swing-arm flat screen TV, bertoia diamond chairs, room safe, separate washsink area. Bathroom was a little small and tiles looked like they could use some cleaning and some grout. The bed was comfortable and room was clean, other than the bathroom tiles.Gym was small and a little depressing-blinds were pulled closed to hide the roof fans, gym door probably could have used glass so it didn't seem like you were working out in a prison gym.Business center was nice-I printed out directions to our Sonoma hotel.There is a Starbucks attached through the lobby and a mexican restaurant (we did not try, but looked upscale)Overall, a nice stay in an older building with some decent modern updates.How we got the best rate: 229 New Year's Eve, 129 Jan 1st.

I had asked for a handicap room but did not get one. I guess I would rate the hotel as a 3. The road leading to the hotel was very rough....out of control of the hotel.

Upon arrival I was upgraded (sunday night helps with that always) and the room was nice and shower was just fine.I ran into problem with a very slow internet connection and after making every attempt to fix it on my end... after speaking to a colleague I realized it was simply the internet was bad. This made it very difficult and had to walk and send some documents from a coffee shop. All easy fixes in all honesty.Where i was very disappointed was with the cleanliness of my bed. After waking up and checking that all window were shut as it felt if someone was smoking in my face I realized my pillow had not been washed or were just that old that they reeked of smoke and it actually gave me a bit of a soar throat.

"We were disappointed in our weekend at this holiday inn. I chose this hotel because it was the most expensive in the Fond du Lac area which I hoped meant it would be the nicest. The room was small and nothing special.The pool and hot tub area were very nice and there was a sports bar which must be why the cost was so much.We were especially disappointed when we paid $25 extra per night for ""free breakfast"" . There were 4 of us in the room. We were only given coupons for 2 breakfasts. THe breakfast buffet was not very good and only cost $7.95 so Im not sure how paying $25 extra per night justified that. It was a total rip off. The 2nd morning we didn't even eat their breafast, instead we went to mcDonalds and had their oatmeal which is great for $2 and their coffee, also good for $1.The only reason I would stay here again is if I had kids that really wanted a big pool and hot tub.

"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel.",Good Time in Waikiki,5

"I was a little tentative to come here because we usually stay at another hotel we really like. We were picking our daughter up from college and this hotel was just what we needed. The room and hotel was clean and it was quiet. The breakfast was good. I would recommend gettng some sugar free syrup.I have to say, I love the staff at this hotel. They are REALLY nice people. Steven at the front desk is very nice and I can't say enough about Brian Knopp. We were moving our daughter out of the dorm and she had extra activities she was involved with and it was leaving us with little time and we didn't know how we were going to manage it. In talking we Steve, he said he could give us an extra hour at check out , but not only that, they let us come back later in the day to freshen up before an event we had to go to. I had asked to use the public bathroom, but Brian wouldn't have that and let use a vacant room. We only needed it for about 30 minutes, so it worked out perfectly. We were so grateful for the hospitality they provided.I would come back to this hotel in a heart beat.We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team. Your survey responses will serve as encouragement to all of our staff as we strive to continuously improve the quality of our services to provide an exceptional experience for our guests.

"We have stayed at this hotel several times over the years and it is so nice to be so close to the entrance of Disneyland at such a reasonable price (reasonable at least for a hotel right at the Disneyland entrance). On our last visit Jan 31st we were pleasantly surprised to find a new GM in place and the place looking especially spiffy. Our room was spacious, the refrigerator is large (for a hotel room) and all was very comfortable. We were able to arrange to stay parked there the entire day even though we had officially checked out as we headed into the park.

"Check in at this beautiful hotel was effortless, professional and helpful. I asked for two restaurant recommendations and both were winners! We stayed four nights in room 804 which at first glance appeared smaller than expected, but, as it turned out, was just the right size for our two overhead sized suitcases to place on the luggage racks. The room includes a desk with chair, a refrigerator, a small three drawer chest, two night tables, a nice sized closet with lots of hangers, room safe, and a most comfortable bed. Water pressure in the shower was not so good. Wake-up call service did not happen on one of the two mornings that we had requested. Our room was immaculate, linens were great, lighting, both natural and artificial was really good and the location was absolutely perfect!! Within walking distance to many attractions and less than a two minute walk to China Town! Breakfast was included with our room. The restaurant is beautiful and relaxing and the server, Worem, is exceptionally welcoming, warm, and most attentive. Breakfast was a hit and miss, one day perfect and the remaining days, sadly, off. Highly recommend visiting Alcatraz, Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory at 56 Ross Alley in China Town and of course, walking around China Town.It's fantastic to hear you had an effortless stay! We're always so happy to give any recommendations, and we're glad they ended up working out for you. Please keep us in mind the next time you're in San Francisco. It would be great to see you back.

You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach.

"The location and speed of check in were superior. However, the room had a broken lamp in the dimly lit room and 2 light bulbs out in the bathroom, so that made the already dark room a little too dark. The charm of the molding and the brick wall in the room were nice, but we could hear every creak the ceiling made when the person above us walked across the floor. It sounded as if they were walking non-stop after 8 am, and it obstructed sleep after that point. We were in room 232-which was near the staircase, so I don't know if this played a factor or if it is like this in other rooms.Hi Sarah, thank you for choosing our historic French Quarter hotel and taking the time to share your valuable feedback!

"OK. It is not Bali, but it comes close. Our room was ocean front, second floor with porch, but entry just up four stairs. Couches and easy chairs on an ample porch right on the ocean...this alone was body and soul cleansing. Inside, a nice living room, full working complete kitchen, dining table, an desperate bedroom with a comfy king bed and decent bathroom. But this does really not describe Pantai. Add in an Ari Ungung, which of course is a fire pit, huge, and the place for a bottle of wine at night. Or perhaps tables after dark with fire heaters Breakfast, well prepared, top quality, and varied every morning. But then there is the service. Everyone, I mean everyone was gracious, polite, sincere, wanting to please, friendly and accommodating. You are greeted by a wonderful, ok, very pretty, Russian woman from St. Petersburg, who just makes you feel like you have chosen the right place, down to the fellow who comes around 7 PM to turn down the bed and leave chocolates and a hand inscribed good night note. This is a most unusual place in that superb management shows through everywhere in the most gracious way. We will return!ZBGreetings zabriskibound,Thank you for taking the time to review Pantai Inn. I really enjoyed reading your description of what a unique place our oceanfront Inn is. There are very few (if any) places like us.

"It's a downtown-type hotel, and the total price will be higher because of parking and wi-fi charges. Everything was clean and worked properly save for the wi-fi which was adequate for email. Friendly staff. Comfy beds and bathrooms. Elevators do not work without your room key save between lobbies. Parking is painfully expensive. Don't park at Lenox Square. I've been told they are vigilant and will ticket you if you park there and go elsewhere.

"Parking was not convenient. We had to walk past two buildings and between two others to reach our room (outside in the rain, of course). The building looked like an old apartment building that had been converted to a hotel. The bathroom ceiling above the shower looked as if it had fallen. It was repaired with a patch, but the plaster was so thin that you could still see the squares in the patch. The room had obviously been painted recently however, it was not taped off so the trim and ceiling had paint smeared on them as well. The frame around the mirror was also chipped. The bathroom counter top was the only nice thing in the room. Our suite was filthy. The stove had black grime built up around the burners, the carpeting was heavily stained in the traffic areas and thread bare to the point you could see the cement floor underneath where the seems used to be. There were ripples in the carpet from where it had loosened and needed stretched. The ceiling by the air conditioning vent was black from dust build up. The light fixtures in the bathroom were disgusting as well. The build up of dust was so bad, you could not even wipe it off with your finger. To top things off, the toilet did not flush, I had to remove the lid to the tank and pull up on the mechanism to make it flush.

"Poor customer service. Well, when people ask how my trip to Portland was I must reply it was great once we got to the right hotel. Several years ago we took advantage of a big deal package at the Governors Hotel, it was very pleasant, a nice room with a fireplace, the steam room and pool. So I planned, a couple of months ahead, a get away for my husbands birthday. When I first looked at the big deal, I did not see any rooms available, so I went to the Governors Hotel website and made reservations for the Winter Warmer. A couple of weeks later, I got an email s that talked about Portlands Big Deal, so I checked The Governors Hotel, and they were now available- having such a nice time last time, I called and asked if they were the same deal, but the big deal being just bit less expensive- Oh, yes, they are the same. I commented that I wanted a fireplace room like last time- oh yes that should not be a problem. So I cancelled my winter warmer reservation and made a reservation on the big deal and made a note in the note box- fireplace. When we arrived our room was on the 2nd floor and about the size of a closet. The hallway was full of restaurant noise, and the view as the desk person called it was of a very dirty and ugly center courtyard. We went down to the desk and complained and told of our last experience and expectations. The gal at the desk told us that rooms were assigned that morning- I do find it interesting that people making reservations over a month in advance get the smallest, noisiest room- I guess it does not pay to plan ahead. So I called another hotel that came to our rescue and treated us with the greatest of care. I now paid for parking, and paid for a more for a room- both items that I had not planned on- I would have taken the train rather than pay for downtown parking. As a reply to this note i was told that i was lucky not to have been charged for the same day cancellation.",Great business hotel,5

What I couldn't overlook was the layer of dust and cobwebs covering the drapes that blows all over the room every time the air kicks on, or the toilet that isn't attached to the floor properly, or the drafty window, mildew stained tile, torn curtains, and cracked microwave door. I also wasn't expecting to spend all night smelling the food from the banquet rooms downstairs. I wasn't expecting to be amazed at the price I paid for this room, but I was at least expecting to have had them keep up with routine maintenance and cleaning, and maybe put in some air fresheners in the hallway to counteract the smells from the banquets.

"Staff was courteous and room was clean but everything else was a let down. If you want to stay in an antique hotel, this is the place. They patched it up as much as possible but imagine staying in a 50's vintage house. Also no elevator and parking was 25. The room was definitely not worth the high price I had to pay. The only great thing was the location downtown close to the Space Needle and the arena across the street.",Old overpriced hotel in a great location,2

The room had a bad odor, and the air conditioning did not work all that well. The website stated that the rooms had a fridge, but did not. It also has an outdoor pool that was not opened. It was covered up and had not been opened yet this year. And when it's 94 degrees outside that would have been nice to use the pool. My overall rating for this hotel would be poor.",Good location,1

"Booked travel  pkg through Expedia, never again!. Would have left immediately, but everywhere else  booked for this event  and left us stuck !..Dirty filthy ,roaches all over the place. Now I don't expect much from a cheap hotel and it is CHEAP but it is by far the worst I have ever seen and im not a 5 star hotel ,complaining wimp. But I had to write my very first hotel review!!.All 5 of the rooms we went through/viewed  in 3 nights smelled  BAD, the floors were so dirty and gross I never took my shoes off. The bathrooms were full of mold and filth the tubs look like someone tried to paint them 10 yrs ago and you didn't want to be be barefoot in there believe me.One shower had the on/off valve at the shower  head? Nicotine stained ceilings/walls with holes in them. Terrrible beds with bed bugs!  springs popping out ,comforters with all sort of unknown stains.The last room had the stove removed,leaving the natural gas pipe/valve  exposed with no plug on the line allowing anyone to turn it on.That is a very serious Hazard. The kind that LEVELS buildings killing everyone.When I told the desk she said oh thought they plugged those up..Im pretty sure these are rented as apartments during off peak times cheaper.The kind of damage substained to these rooms doesn't come from travelers with their families, there was grease so thick on the range hood and sides of the stoves you could scrape it off.The doors had all been kicked in and broke the trim making the doors barely able to latch",WARNING.

"El hotel en general est muy bien. El personal es encantador (recepcionistas, camareros/as, cocineros/as, limpiadoras, animadores, etc...). La habitacin amplia y muy limpia con camas muy cmodas. El buffet est bien pero un poco repetitivo despus de dos o tres das. Lo peor son los horarios que estn muy adaptados al turismo extranjero pero tampoco es un problema. La piscina la cierran a las 18:00 horas y recogen las hamacas aunque te puedes quedar ms tiempo. Los horarios de animacin tambin estn pensados para extranjeros. Si llegas ms tarde de las 21:30 olvdate de ver el espectculo de turno. No te dejan sacar platos del restaurante de la piscina para que te los lleves a las hamacas.

"Carpets/rooms are too perfumed/scented for me. Not good for some with sensitivities to scents such as myself and for use of my CPAP machine for sleep apnea since the scent gets absorbed into my machne filters. Please consider getting a fragrence free deoderizer for carpets/rooms or at least a very lightly scented one. The overpowering scents also made me nauseated from time to time. Breakfast had a fairly good assortment, but could use a change in the egg product. The eggs taste too much like a reconstituted procseed egg product for me. The fresh toast sticks available at times were a great addition to breakfast. The front desk staff were exceptional and provided awesome friendly service. Shuttle personel also great and friendly.

She actually brought one to the counter. I immediately checked out. I am extremely disappointed. I think corporate should take a serious look at what the hotel manager does at this site, clearly, she does not hold hotel staff accountable, if house keeping is allowed to make beds up without changing sheets between tenants.

People coming out of the nightclub opposite still got a bit noisy on a couple of nights (I was there over the Memorial Day weekend) but I'm a light sleeper and it didn't disturb me over-much. There was worse noise from the room upstairs: the floors (although carpeted) are wooden, and there must have been a family of elephants staying up there! It still wasn't enough to put me off though. If you want a quiet hotel, don't stay in the middle of the entertainment quarter!Service was good, my room was clean, and breakfasts were fine.If you want an experience that's a little different from the McDonald's type of hotel, this one is for you :-)","Cute, quirky, and comfortable",5

"This was my second time at this hotel. I was there with friends in November 2011 and again with same friends plus one extra,a group of 4 ladies total. The staff is the best, helpful, friendly, and outgoing. The room we had this time was the Penthouse with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. I believe there are two penthouses but I don't know if they are both 2 bedrooms. We had a small balcony and a view of the park and Sears/Willis Tower. The room itself was in need of some cosmetic repair,peeling wall paper, paint scraped in spots, water damage marks. The place was functional for us and we did not complain, we were just happy to be back in Chicago. The room we had on our first visit was an executive suite facing the River and was in much better condition. This will continue to be my go to place in Chicago because of the staff and I know that not all rooms are in need of repair. I still believe this is one of the best hotels in Chicago. Thank you Comfort Suites staff!Thank you so much for sharing your experiences and your loyalty to our hotel. I am so pleased that you enjoyed the space in your room. We will certainly ensure we work to ensure any repairs are completed. The staff will be thrilled to see your kind compliments on their service. Please do not hesitate to contact us directly when you are next in Chicago.Safe Travels,Natalie Furka-Padgett",Great Staff!,4

"Hotel is right off of the main highway into VA Beach, so it's very quick to get in and out. It is right by the boardwalk as well, within walking distance of the pier. So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus. Wife and kids loved the balcony facing the ocean, we enjoyed watching the beach at dusk. Overall, we had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this Comfort Inn and will definitely book it for next year's trip back to VA Beach.",Pretty nice hotel overall.,5

"Despite me booking a superior room, two weeks ahead of my visit, I was put in room 1 which is directly behind the hotel bar and reception on the ground floor. Couldn't get to sleep until from 9 till 12 (I had a very early business meeting the next day) due to the noise coming from some guests enjoying a drink in the bar. Not even a loud group, just a terribly designed layout where you can hear every conversation from that room. I think it is outrageous that a supposedly superior room is in such a location of the hotel. When I complained that night to the receptionist he told me to speak to the manager - the next morning the lady at reception told me they had never heard a complaint about this room. Unfortunately this must be a lie as the room is so noisy!!! Also no way to control the heating in the room, very small, the breakfast is OK but the room it is served in is not that clean and the selection is basic. Room service is overpriced (10 for soup, 20 for pasta), slow and very limited. Avoid as this hotel certainly does not deserve a 4* rating.",Don't get stuck in room 1!,2

Great location, within walking distance to both inner harbor and Fells Point, with plenty of bars and restaurants and shopping. the hotel is right around the corner from a couple of great restaurants (my fave: Ten/Ten) and Whole Foods. the staff is always very nice but the hostess at the front couldn't figure out where the rooms with a view of the harbor were, so although she tried to accommodate our request, we ended up with a room facing the opposite direction, looking at a brick wall... other than than, the hotel is great. very convenient bar/snack station in the lobby, great hot breakfast, and fabulous gym (small pool).",great second stay-will come back,5

"I had booked this room through Travelocity so it was paid in full. We decided to book here because I wanted to treat my family to TWO king beds and had booked this type of room. We arrived at 5:00 pm after traveling all day and was told our room was not ready even though check in was at 3:00. Told the manager that was unacceptable and he offered a one king/one sofa room. Told him this was unacceptable. He then offered a two queen room. After some haggling I asked for a discount and he offered 30 or 40 and would email Travelocity to adjust my price. Later I ran into him and he asked if I needed anything and I said an email from Travelocity with my refund which he said I would get in 10 minutes. By morning still no email so I called Travelocity directly who was WONDERFUL and called the manager while I was on hold and got the refund processed. Had I not called I am certain there would not have been a refund issued. As for this place: Run as fast as you can. There are people here that must rent by the month and are quite shady. Lots of garbage built up outside rooms, the parking lot has thousands of cigarette butts, lots of partying and ruckus during the night. Our bathroom had dirty footprints and there was literally a hole in the wall where the cable line is and we could see straight through to our neighbors room. The grounds are a mess. Breakfast was a complete joke. Make your own eggs in an electric fry pan. But there were no eggs, only 4 pieces of toast and a few mini muffins left that I put on a plate for my still sleeping family and got yelled at by the scary looking front desk worker when I arrived at 8:00. Yes, there was a sign that says no food out of the breakfast area but at that point I did not care about following the rules. A nice lady eating breakfast after me dug through the cabinets and found an extra container of muffins and a box of frosted flakes but according to other people eating they forgot to go shopping and that is why they were short on food. The dispenser for the juice was not filled---instead you poured your own from the jugs they had from the store that who knows how long were sitting out.",RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN FROM THIS PLACE,1
"We stayed 2 nights at the hotel. We needed to find a VW garage for the car and the staff were very helpful in both locating and contacting the garage for us. The hotel is situated about -15 minutes bus ride outside Florence, the bus stop is outside the hotel and is cheap, frequent and easy to use. The views over Florence are fantastic from the terrace and you can have a drink and just watch the world go by. We booked a queen room and got a suite, which was really useful for a couple travelling round Europe for 3 weeks. Our bedroom also has a really interesting ceiling, so the hotel has plenty of character. We ate dinner in the hotel on the second night of our stay-great food with good sized portions (we shared anti-pasta and cheese). We visited Fiesole on our final day, also worth a visit.",Great hotel with amazing views over Firenze.,5

After two days of living here, I could have stayed on. I loved the location, there is a Starbucks and CVS at a walkable distance - just across from the hotel. The rooms are clean, and big sized. It's structured like a suite, so you get some living room space too. The kitchen is well equipped. It's well connected, they have a complimentary wi if service and the internet speed is good. The only downside being that the area is not considered very safe, but I didn't encounter any issues.The breakfast is very average, No in-house restaurant. I don't like their wash rooms, very small and the products are very very average - I would recommend to carry your own shampoo, body wash etc along.

The women at the counter were both very nice and helpful. Some of the building areas were falling apart.

"When we first saw the hotel, we thought it was strange to see and outside entrance Marriott property, but once we entered the lobby, we felt right at home. As Platinum Elite members, we were upgraded to a small suite. That was great, but when we pulled out the couch we saw there was no sheets, nor blanket for the pull out. When we called to get the needed sheets and blankets, a very sweet and helpful housekeeping staff, Rosemary from Jamacia came immediately and helped make up the bed right there and explained how every pull out blanket is washed after each time it was used. We appreciated her enthusiasm and kindness. The next day, we realized we need to extend another day and spoke with Nakayla Butler at the front desk. Wow, she worked some magic and got us in another night despite being full. This is why I have been staying exclusively at Marriott properties for over 40 years. This property even had a concierge, Jamie who seems to know every street and bargain to be found in Key West. You just cannot find a more consistently quality hotel chain than Marriott. Thanks to everyone at the Key West Marriott Fairfield Inn for a wonderful stay.Thank you for your comments regarding your wonderful stay with us. It great to hear the team members Rosemary, Nakayla and Jamie made the difference in your visit. I appreciate your comments and your loyalty to Marriott.

There were mosquitoes and and other insects all over the hallways and near the ice machine.  We were glad we were staying only for one night.

"My husband and I are staying here (We are still here, I just couldn't wait to write this review. I even created a new account on TripAdvisor because I couldn't recover mine from years ago) with our 2 year old and I am 8 months pregnant. We wanted to have a relaxing, quiet stay in La Jolla and originally heard of Estancia through JetSetter on Gilt.com I am thrilled that we chose to stay at Estancia. It is absolutely beautiful here and very tranquil. My 2 year old loves walking the grounds and everyone has been so friendly with him, even though this isn't exactly a perfect place for children. My son is very calm mannered and we thought it would be okay, especially after seeing on different review sites that they are so welcoming of families and young ones. The salt water pool feel amazing on your skin and the cabanas are very chic and well maintained. The restaurant that is open in the evenings has amazing food- upscale mexi-cale comfort food and other choices. The one time we had a real problem with a dessert being sent up to our room 45 min later than ordering it, they sent up a fresh dessert right away, took off the charge, and added about 10 more scoops of ice cream that we didn't ask for :) It was a nice touch.I am definitely coming back here- My husband loved that we were so close to Torrey Pines GC and wants to stay for golf next time. Absolutely serene. Thank you, Estancia La Jolla!!It is simply wonderful to read all about your experience with us so far! We are so happy to read we have been able to help you and your husband have such a relaxing stay and that you have experienced nothing but to top-notch customer service throughout.

Our only real complaint would be that noise carries from the hallway into the room and from the neighboring rooms.

The food in this hotel is horrible and don't waste your time with it. Not only was the food awful (ate at the hotel two times just to give it a second chance) but the service at the restaurant was the worst. My wife and I sat at the table for 20 minutes before someone came by to take our order. Then it was another 20 minutes or so for the food to arrive. So 40 minutes later we were super hungry. We had appetizers the first time and the second time actual dinners. The chicken on the Caesar salad was dry and tough like wood. Then we had a steak which tasted like it came from a frozen meal.

"Our holiday stay at the NOPSI was PERFECT! The hotel and the architecture are spectacular. The staff, from housekeeping to management, was professional, efficient, polite and friendly. The service was just as one would expect from a luxury hotel. I can't say enough about the bartenders at all 3 bars. They were knowledgeable mixologists, friendly and efficient. The view from the rooftop bar is grand and so is the atmosphere. The lobby bar is beautiful and the live music in the evenings was a wonderful treat. Room service was delivered quicker than anticipated and was delicious! Our breakfasts were first class! The 3 egg omelet Pontchartrain, Porchetta Hash and Eggs, Pecan Belgian Waffles and 1/2 Ruby Grapefruit Brle were the best room service meals I believe my husband and I have ever had for breakfast. The room service wait staff was polite and friendly. Although we did not dine at Public Service during this stay, we have in the past and found the food and service to be exemplary. Christmas morning we were greeted with a stocking hanging on our door. The stocking was filled with fresh fruit, candy and baked goods. What a wonderful surprise! The accommodations were beautiful and comfortable. My husband is generally very uncomfortable sleeping in hotel beds and lounging on hotel furniture, but he was very comfortable during our stay at the NOPSI. He was so pleased, that he has already booked the hotel for a return business trip in the near future. Love this beautiful hotel in my favorite city!

"The primary complaint was the inability to enjoy the pool and the beach, because work renovations were going on that left a steady snow like shower of Styrofoam sprinkles that blew over everything and coated the pool. It would seem that some type of netting could have been installed to have prevented this.

Lots of nice restaurants within walking distance, fun open air sitting area in front of hotel, and lovely Marriott club lounge.Stephanie - I am glad you enjoyed our facilities for your recent training session as well as the meals provided. We are definitely convenient to shopping and restaurants and I hope you were able to enjoy some time away from your training to complete your JW experience.

"The location is near I-39 but far away from any restaurants or shopping. Locals told us to stay in at night as it is a bad part of town. We had no problems. The breakfast was powdered scrambled eggs and too spicy, mushy kind of sausage-and the usual continental fare of cereal, rolls, juice, yoghurt. Our room was great for us. A person with mobility difficulties booking on hotels.com should be aware that in this case, a King handicapped accessible room only had bars near the toilet and in the standard bath tub and a larger bathroom door. Also it was on second floor so in a fire, this could be a factor. They have other more accessible rooms on first floor and also rooms for deaf/hard of hearing people which is great, but if you have needs, be sure to ask and specify so you get the right room.","Good overall, specify type if disability access is needed!",4

I was very disappointed with this hotel true it is an older hotel but major repairs are needed starting with the 2 elevators which one has an out of order sign on.. anytime you try to go to the first floor it automatically takes you to the basement then brings you back up. The basement looks scary and filthy if I had the opportunity to see the basement first i know i would never have stayed at this hotel. This is first time I ever felt unsafe at a hotel. The parking deck area needs better lighting to dark. My room was on the 4th floor the hallway smells maybe the carpet needs shampooing or just needs new carpet. The room was clean but bed was very lumpy new mattress needed ...shower pressure was horrible at anytime of the day really horrible ...the free breakfast i woulnt dare eat it do to the lack of upkeep of the facility hotel was...I can't comment on the staff I only saw the front desk person never saw housekeeping crew or maintenance person the hold time.....Otherwise, if the above things dont really bother you then the hotel does offer you a quiet room ....great location (it may not look like it from your hotel window but you're really close to a lot of things) ...good rates...sorry I didn't mean to write a book just wanted to give an honest opinion of my experience. ...",Never Again!!!,1

Ocean Park Inn is right on the beach. There is access that exits to the boardwalk and from there is beach access. Our room was ocean front. Our 3rd floor room had a balcony that looked down on the boardwalk and beach. We sat in the room because it was chilly out and watched the sunset. How great to open the door and hear the roar of the waves. Our room was nice. A little old but clean and quiet. The one negative is that the room was dark when the sun went down.

"I hesitated booking this hotel for my night before an early morning flight because of the reviews stating that the parking lot situation was bad. I thought, how bad can it really be Well....bad! There was literally not a single spot available in the whole lot. People were parked along red curbs, and in fire lanes....I finally parked right in front of the lobby doors just to hop out and ask where in the heck am I supposed to park I was directed to park in front of the pizza place or the Subway in the next parking lot over, as they also own that property. I did find that there were two available spots there. So if I had been even ten minutes later, even this might not have been an option. However, even though I now had a parking spot, I then had to walk over to the hotel, and it was late at night, and I was a female, alone, walking in a neighborhood that I don't know if it was safe or not. I didn't FEEL safe. While checking in, I noticed that they offer to let people leave their cars parked there when they fly out. Which I think is a great thing....if you have the space for it! And it should be something that should be let known to guests booking as well. After the parking fiasco, I was hoping that at least the room would be nice, only to find a hotel room that, while clean, was pretty dingy. But at least the bed was comfy!!","Next time, I'll try somewhere else",2

"We have found this place thanks to Tripadvisor - it didn't pop out on Booking or anywhere else. We used their own website to book the room. What I was looking for was a place near Fisherman Wharf with easily accessible parking. This place went one step ahead and offered free parking and a room with reasonable price.The location is excellent - within walking distance from the wharf, at rather quiet (for S.F. standards) street . If the location is what you care about - I can definitely recommend this hotel. What surprised me (in a good way) was the free WiFi connection which was very fast and reliable, which is not always a case in American hotels. A coffee maker was a nice addition to the room and super cold drinks from the hotel vending machine saved our lives on a very tough morning )OK, now the dark side of the hotel... First of all, it wasn't the place you want to spend a romantic weekend at - it was not perfecly clean, there was this strange smell in the hallway and in the room which gives you a message it's high time to change carpets and mattresses all over the place. But you can get used to it after a day or two )I've mentioned the parking - yes, it was free (yay!) and easy to find. And yes, you could always take your car out without waiting for the valet. But the whole area and parking places themselves were very small and it took me some time to park the car and then get out of it. If you're driving a rental and you don't know and 'feel' the car - it can get a little bit tricky. Last thing was the front desk service...

The receptionist insisted by demanding if otherwise a 200 deposit (we had not known about this condition before) and we agreed about the card.

"We stayed here for three nights while visiting Disneyland. We had two rooms, one standard (for the in-laws) and one suite. We booked the suite in order to have a separate sleeping room for the kids. The extra room, however, was very small (just enough room to unfold the bed) and couldn't be used for much more than sleeping (it had no TV). Strangely, the extra room also lacked any heat (it only had a cooling unit). We were in Anaheim during a cold spell in January so this was problematic but didn't ruin our stay.The standard room seemed a bit more updated than the suite but, aside from some peeling paint, both rooms were clean and comfortable. The hot breakfast was perfect (selection included belgian waffles, eggs, sausages, toast, pastries, cold cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit) but, as has been noted by other reviews, the seating area is woefully inadequate. Fortuntately, we weren't there during a busy time so the lack of room was more of a nuisance than anything else.I estimated the walk to Disneyland front gates to be about a mile. For us, it took 15 to 20 minutes, which was what we expected.Service was friendly and attentive. All in, given the price, we thought the value was excellent and would stay here again.Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay with us.

"my sister and I surprised my husband to a train ride to New Orleans for his bday, we picked this hotel because of the beautiful pictures and great location (close to everything).

"This hotel does no disappoint! From the Front Desk, to Housekeeping, the Shuttle Driver to the Restaurant and Room, they exceed expectations. Not only was the room spotless, housekeeping met me in the hallway upon arrival to ask if they could do anything else! The Bartender is AWESOME - Jim creates his own mixes from scratch and crafts each cocktail individually, no fake stuff here, all done with a great sense of humor and a bit of showmanship! The location is perfect, next to Little Italy and the restaurant/bar seating is indoor/outdoor almost park like with cushy couches and chairs. When in this city I am use to overpriced everything. This hotel is the opposite, from the cocktails to the food, it's quite reasonable. The shuttle driver is super friendly and at your service, upon arrival at Racine Station, I called and the van showed up in less than 5 minutes! On one occasion took us to 7-11, waited for us while we bought water, coffee, etc . When we called from Francesca's on Taylor, he was there in less than 5 minutes. All in all, this hotel is a Chicago Gem. We were in town for the NRA (Restaurant) show and the city was completely booked. 10.50 cab ride to McCormick and QUICK! This hotel will be my place when in Chicago! PS: I was on Marriott Points during their busiest time of year and was still treated like gold!","Friendly, Clean, Great Location and Great Restaurant",5

"My wife and I are frequent visitors to the Disney parks and have stayed at 9 different hotels in the neighborhood, varying from 3 1/2 star hotels across the street to 2 star hotels a good distance away. Overall, this hotel is our absolute favorite place to be when we visit Disney. It is a slightly longer walk (20-25 minutes) than most people would like, but the value added here is definitely worth an extra ten minutes of walking. First, the service here is wonderful. The front desk is always very helpful and willing to accommodate requests. They also have free parking and free breakfast, and the breakfast actually has options and enough food to cover an entire meal. It is not a grab and go style to gives you a mini muffin and cup of coffee, but actually allows you and your family a free meal that also helps with budgeting trips. Also, we have always enjoyed the rooms and never had an issue with cleanliness. The beds are comfy and the in-room mini fridge and coffee makers are great. It is a little noisy, but simply leaving the fan on gives enough white noise to be able to sleep. To anyone looking for a budget friendly option that is still close enough to the parks that you can walk every day, this is definitely worth checking out!",Great value and clean hotel,4

"We have been to this hotel probably about 3 times but this time our room was very small so a little disappointed. Luckily we are not there too much so it was ok. Rooms were cleaned late in the afternoon usually after 3pm so if we were out during the day it was a little unlucky that you couldn't rest until your room was cleaned because you would be woken. Rooms were clean bed was comfortable and staff were friendly. I think when you want them to book you a shuttle and you have a coupon that is cheap it was suggested that the shuttle company was unreliable so recommended who they used which was a bit more expensive. The water for the tea and pre made coffee was not hot enough in the foyer so I would always check first and if not hot enough the staff are able to get hot water for you out the back from a room which wasn't a problem for them. The hotel is situated in a side street which is quieter but close to everything. To catch a trolley was easy you just walk down the laneway next to the hotel and you are at the DFS where they start from so you would get a seat .Aloha,Thank you for your feedback!

We were on the second floor by the pool (not sure if all rooms face the pool) and it was good. Only had one instance where a group of loud girls were in the pool area and it was definitely loud in our room, but thankfully it didn't last long. Overall a quiet place. Got vouchers for Denny's next door, easy and fast breakfast before our days. I saw some reviews mentioning traffic due to the location, but it was always an easy in/out for us.

The hot breakfast was good, eggs, a different meat everyday, waffles etc..A lot of channels on the TV to chose from, we did have a washout day with 7 inches of rain so staying in the room was more pleasant and free WIFI.

"Cherokee Lodge is in a perfect location. We flew into San Diego, took the Super Shuttle to Coronado for 14 and never needed a car again. The BB is a short 5 min walk to the beautiful beach just north of the Del Coronado Hotel and a 1 minute walk to Orange Ave with all the cute shops and restaurants. The lodge staff are excellent, very friendly and accommodating. The room was spotless and the grounds quaint and cute. We spoke to several guests who have stayed there previous times and returned because of the staff. We stayed in Rm 4 which was very roomy with a king bed and a bigger bathroom than most of the rooms. But I understand Rm 5 and Rm 6 have king beds and are bigger rooms yet. I did peek into Rm 3 which has a king but that bathroom was really tiny. This isn't a typical BB as they don't cook breakfast. Instead they give a voucher for breakfast at Panera Bread which is across the street. We liked that because we could eat anytime from 6:30-10:30am rather than having to get up early. The food was delish too. Also, the lodge provides beach towels AND sand chairs! Enjoy your trip.",Hidden Coronado Paradise,5

"We needed a hotel near enough to the airport for a late-arrival into San Diego, and the BW Hacienda was an affordable choice. The service desk staff was friendly enough, but we did have to wait more than an hour for the shuttle to arrive at the airport for the 10-minute drive to the hotel. Being upfront about the delay could have let us call Uber to shorten our 13-hour travel day. The facility was clean enough, but a bit dated in style. There was some language miscommunication with the cleaning staff, but my fault for not running it through the front desk. The property is built on a multi-level terraced hill with multiple steps, patios, and elevators, so double-check your room location if you have concerns about walking any distance. We were about as far from the front desk as possible and had trouble remembering our route the first day. LOLThe free breakfast buffet was a nice surprise, with many options and good service.Thank you for your feedback. I am glad you found the hotels location convenient, your room clean and the staff friendly. Well pass your shuttle comments to the team to take a look at our efficiency levels. Normally, we dont have a problem with timing. Regarding your comment about steps to your room, I want to apologize for any inconvenience this caused. Six of our eight buildings do have elevators but because we are spread out on a hillside, there are also stairs. Please note that our staff is available 24 hours a day to assist with your needs and help you make the most of your stay.

However, for the price and similarly equipped hotels, it is surprising and disappointing that they do not offer complimentary breakfast.

"Hotel was great. Parking is very limited and tight when it's full. However after having Dominos delivered to me, I was told by the front desk that delivery wasn't allowed and not to do it again. This was not mentioned at check in nor was it mentioned online. Found it rude that I was told what to do on my own vacation. The front desk did give me an attitude about it as well even after I told them I was unaware. Other than that the stay was just fine. A bit noisy from time to time if you are staying on the main floor, which I was.","Great stay, rude staff",4

Near shops and lots of restaurants, Starbucks and CVS right out the door.  Not close to metro, so we took cabs to all the sights.  Wine for free everyday for one hour where we met many nice people.

"Never had such bad experience before. Stayed in this hotel for 9 nights, there were so many incidents happened during my stay.First night, I requested double room when I check in, they gave me three times twin room.And I asked for a room with the view, they said I have to pay 6USD extra, which I agreed, then I found it was much more than what I have been told. Second night, I was being locked outside of my room. After changing the key card three times, they found out that it was the lock issue,they asked me to wait in the lobby till midnight, and then arranged me a room next door,which was not even cleaned thoroughly. Yuk, imagine that sleeping at a room with someone else left belongings.Third day, I was being notified that the lock of my room was fixed, so I can move back to my own room, such a relief, I was wondering what I am gonna do if I couldnt get back to my room, since all my stuffs are there. So I took a quick shower before going back to my room. Guess what I have found out when I change back to my own room The door was left unlocked and nobody was there!!! I had to quick check if anything was missing. Just when I decided to relax a bit in my room, someone came in my room without even knocking my door. He left immediately when he saw I was in the room without saying a word. I went to ask what that was for, he told me he just want to confirm if I need room service. I think that makes sense, and I answered yes, I need. but why didnt he knock first I went out for sightseeing during the day, when I get back to the room, it was exact the same as I left, nobody came to clean it. So I called them to ask why they didnt do the housekeeping since they came to my room specifically to ask if I require room service, which I answered yes, in the morning. They did send someone over to do it though after that phone call.Fourth day, since I thought they just did the cleaning the late night before, I left my room with DND sign on the door. Guess what happened My room was cleaned!!! Whats more, I was locked in the elevator for nearly ten minutes that night, and I had to call for help.Fifth day, I found my credit card has been charged by the hotel with a strange amount of money. So I called them to ask why. The person who answered the phone said they will investigate and get back to me. I was waiting and waiting, still no answer, until I get back to the hotel at the night, I had to explain myself again with what happened to another their staff. Yet, still no answer.Sixth day, they charged my credit card again, which makes me so furious, since they just did whatever they want without asking for my permission. Seventh day, after I called four times, finally, they found the reason why my credit card has been charged.Because they didnt preauthrize enough money when I checked in, so they have to do it again and again. I said why it is different amount of money then, they couldnt give me a straight answer. And when I asked why they didnt inform me first Yet, no straight answer.Eighth night, I have been charged again, but I could guess what it was for already.The check out day was the most smooth day during my entire stay. I asked them to print my bill. And I am so glad that I did.To be fair, the location of this hotel is really nice, since it is just next to the Space Needle. The breakfast is too blunt. Strong smell of the decoration for not only the lobby, also the room. But the attitude of their staff is really good. And they are actually quite helpful. So I wasnt going to write my experience until today when I saw the final invoice I was being charged around 60USD for parking fee. Ironically, I dont even have a driving license, and I have never drove a car!!! This is soooooooo ridicules. I have stayed in many hotels in variety locations around the world, never suffered as badly as in this hotel. Worst experience ever and super disappointed.Dear mgx2222,Thank you so much for choosing to stay at Hyatt Place during your recent trip to Seattle. I would like to first and foremost apologize on behalf of the hotel and entire staff for the unsatisfactory experience you encounter during your recent visit. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. I could make excuses about the newness of the hotel and the lack of experience of our staff, but that doesnt rectify your inconvenience. Its important for us to hear the feedback from our guests, as we want to improve and make the necessary changes that lead to positive experiences. We are addressing these concerns with the appropriate departments. We always want to be a part of great travel memories. Please let us know when you come back to Seattle as we would love to welcome you back!Sincerely, Sarah Junge",worst experience ever,1
"The front desk staff was wonderful and as helpful as can be. This was especially true, when our room had mold on the windows and drapes and smelled of damp. We were immediately moved to the only other available room, which, unfortunately also had mold (this time in bathroom) and damp. It was supposed to be a more expensive room because it overlooked St Charles Street, which under cover of night seems to have lots of inebriated individuals and street pharmacists doing business. We couldn't use the elevator for a short time after the ceiling fell in on another guest and had to be repaired. The bed was comfortable and would have contributed to a good nights sleep except for the damp smell. Both the room we started with and the room we eventually slept in were a bit small for two twin beds and a family of four with teenagers.The staff made sure the rest of our four-night reservation was cancelled and let us keep our car in the secured parking lot while we explored the French Quarter the next day even after we had checked out. They were helpful despite our unpleasant stay due circumstances beyond their control. Because of the helpfulness and friendliness of the front desk staff, I wish that I could give this hotel a higher rating, but as we could not even stay past the first night of our reservation (and then only because it was late and dark and we had no other place to go), I could not recommend this hotel.David,I'm very sorry we did not exceed your expectations during your stay. The issues you encountered have been addressed by housekeeping. We have rooms with two double beds and one king bed. I'm sorry the room with two double beds seemed small for your family. I hope your time in New Orleans was enjoyable and you were able to see a lot while site-seeing after you checked out. We always want to accommodate our guests by letting them their cars with us a little longer!Again, I am very sorry you did not enjoy your stay. I hope you will consider staying with us again, so we can have a chance to provide you with excellent service. Kathleen Davis, Front Office Manager",Damp and Mold,1

"Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER. I will never stay here again--for the same money you can stay at the EconoLodge next door--certainly no better, but how could it be worse",Over 30? Stay away!,1

"I travel on business nationwide constantly, and I'm gold level for most chains: now I know why I don't stay at Sheratons often. Their location on Bourbon Street is bad enough. It took my 1/2 to go one block due to all the drunk revelers walking in the street, and the GPS didn't know what to do. By the time I got to the front desk, I was tired to the point of tears, and the front desk staff were cold, unfriendly and rude. As it turns out the Starwood computer system messed up and showed me as arriving the next night. Despite seeing a well dressed, exhausted middle aged woman asking for help, the front desk lady just looked at me and said, loudly, You're here on the wrong night!looking at me as though I were an idiot. She made NO effort to find me room, NOR did she even offer to call another hotel to get me a room, even though it was almost midnight, for my plane had been delayed three hours!!!

"My wife and I do extended road trips and always try to find good local restaurants that focus on food and not necessarily on presentation. We then go 'high end' for a few days (boutique hotels and fancier restaurants). This falls in between the two.The hotel is very nice and clean but the rooms are quite small (at least the standard rooms). Staff is attentive and polite but do not expect high end resort attentiveness. Parking is valet and your 26 dollars a night is basically a parking fee. You can take the trolley to the Garden District and walk the rest of the Quarter (4 blocks to Bourbon, 3 to Jackson Sq. another 3 to French Market). We got a King bed, 2 people for roughly 90 a night (mon-tues). Not bad from what I could tell on internet searches",Great Value Close to Jackson Sq,4

Staff are also very unfriendly and not willing to assist. Even an iron is only provided when asked for 3-4 times. And for the amount we paid as welll, would have expected a bit better service and a nicer room and area for the hotel to be in. It was okay as we only went there to sleep, but it's not nice still. try to avoid this hotel.",Bad hotel,2
They are remodeling so what they've done so far looks great. Our room was freshly painted but the bed spread was dirty and had stains on it and the bathroom had hair in the shower and on the toilet. The Windows had hand prints all over them and people were outside in the parking lot very late being super loud for over an hour. The price was great and it smelled clean. If you're just going for somewhere to sleep i would recommend this hotel because overall it was nice but if you're looking to stay somewhere to be in the room it's probably not for you.,Needs better cleaning.,4

"I am a loyal Hampton Inn guest and a Hilton Honors member. I stay at Hampton Inns multiple times each year. The Orlando/Sea World Hampton Inn has the least accommodating and least friendly staff I have seen. No smiles, no hellos, no thank yous.On my last morning there, I requested a late checkout. I was told that late checkouts were not allowed, but as a courtesy I could check out 30 minutes late. Later, when I came to check out at my newly approved time, the same employee who gave me permission to check out late, reprimanded me for checking out late. I reminded her that she had given me permission to do so. She said I would be charged for a half day next time. This was not the service I've come to expect from Hilton. I won't go back to this location.","Clean hotel, subpar customer service",3

They were renovating. Thats fine but to have the elevator incomplete with wood boards hanging made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I just started taking the stairs. The rooms we're supposedly non smoking but smelled like smoke. The first room the fridge didn't work so they decided to upgrade us to a king on a higher level. We get there and fridge doesn't work either. We call to get a replacement but they couldn't. Typically we wouldn't have cared to much but we traveled 600 miles and just didn't want our food going bad. Which it did. It was a decent neighborhood. Great for shopping.,My stay,2
"We chose Hotel An Der Philharmonia due to its convenient location, being close to local Restaurants, bars, shops and the Rhine (ideally situated because we'd booked to go to an outdoor gig at the Rhinepark), and the hotel has a good overall star rating. We arrived on an unusually hotter day than normal for the time of year - around 30 degrees C on the Sunday before August Bank Holiday Monday! The hotel unfortunately does not have air-conditioning, and with our room being on the top (4th) floor, it was quite stuffy. Fortunately, there was a standalone air cooler in the room that was running, and we opened up the windows to cool ourselves down. It is for this reason only that we did not give Room Comfort and Hotel Facilities a five star rating. We'd asked for a quiet room, and that's what we got, being light sleepers. We had breakfast at the hotel, which we enjoyed, thanks to the variety and quality of food available. The hotel staff were friendly and courteous, which is one of the main reasons why we would be happy to stay there again, and recommend the hotel to anyone looking to stay in Cologne, or as a base from which to take day trips, being as the railway station is nearby.","Good hotel, close to local amenities and the Rhine",4

"Well, we arrived at the hotel around 10pm, after a long drive and had to wait in line for about 30 min to check in. Some how they only had one person to check every one. For the price we paid, I was expecting a better experience... The only reason I booked that room was because it had a tub/shower however, the tub was dirty, I could not even used it( We had no tv remote control in the room and the hallway stank badly!! The casino was nice, but no one came up to offer us a drink. The restaurant was ok, the food was marginal. The best part was walking around the neighborhood, it is a great location!! We walked back to our room around 2 am and the check in line was still going strong... Checking out next morning was a nightmare, people complaining of various situations and still having to wait in line for awhile, this time at least they had 2 people at the front desk! They never asked how our stay was, and when I mentioned we had no tv remote in the room the guy said oh well, maybe the last guest just took it I don't like to complain and understand sometimes things happens, but come on...

"My son was attending the PAX convention and has stayed at this hotel before. Great location for everything. Staff were overall great and helped us with a broken handle on our luggage. The only issue I have is why hotels in general only provide towels for two guests in a room that sleeps four We had asked for early booking, but the room was not ready. After a long flight I chose to wait in the lobby and it was awfully cold. My husband and son had left to attend a baseball game. When I got to the room after a two-hour wait, I then had to call down to get extra towels, as I knew there were not enough for all of us. We had a view of the space needle which was great. We were very pleased to find the mini-bar was empty and we could stock up the fridge with refreshments. At over 350.00/night with all the fees/taxes, it was pricey. There was a caf accessible from the hotel and we made a lot of use of it for a quick breakfast before heading out to see the sights. Overall it was really good, but expensive.","Great location, very nice hotel, pricey",4

We were given a room on the 1st floor by the spa area. It was very loud. There were people up late talking. The beds were uncomfortable and each bed only had 3 little square pillows. Around 8:30pm a whole bus of people came took up what seemed to be the whole second floor. They were very loud. Then around 6am that whole bus of people all left and once again were loud inconsiderate of the people sleeping. We were also next to stairs so you could hear them trying to roll/drop their suitcase all the way down the stairs talking loud. I would pay to stay at a better place next time. The only thing that gave this hotel edge over others was it is walking distance from the Marina Dunes State Beach we watched the sunset into the ocean with our family.,Book elsewhere,2
"Perfect hotel for family vacation. Plenty to do at the hotel, including programming for kids of all ages. Activities are geared both for kids to do on their own and to involve parents when they want. The hotel pool is great, overlooking the slopes and there are several hot tubs. Specific activities our family enjoyed were the magic show on Wed night, the smores nights and a few of the movies. Our 9 yo son loved the blast room (game room) and spent the day/night going back and forth between this area and the pool with his new friends. Next to the pool are several community grills, which many families used and we will next time.

"This motel really doesn't feel safe. The lobby is closed at night with only a small bank teller window to interact with the front desk staff. The parking lot had lots of trash from fast food restaurants next door. My room's metal door was kicked and dented so badly that it had a huge gap at the bottom through which daylight, and noise passed. The bed was rock hard. The carpet was dirty. The room smelled of stale smoke even though it was supposedly a non-smoking room. The shower head was underwhelming and too low for a man of average height. The elevator interior is just plywood and creaked as the elevator ascended. This motel offers no amenities other than a single bar of soap and a single bottle of shampoo.

"This property appears to be fairly new. The common areas and rooms are very well appointed and extremely clean. This is one of the best looking Hampton Inn properties I have experienced in a very long time. There were some issues that were severe enough to only give this property a 3/5 star rating. The rooms were not built well enough to block sounds from the corridors and adjoining rooms. I was constantly hearing people open and close doors and have conversations in the corridors late into the evening. I reported this the first evening but it never was resolved. Additionally, the housekeeping staff would congregate in the hallways and play loud music while cleaning rooms. This music was easily heard down the halls. This is extremely unprofessional. I also inquired upon arrival (3pm) about purchasing tickets to local attractions on-site. I was told I had to visit the Expedia travel desk at the hotel next door, but it was already closed. The clerk went on to tell me I should just go and buy them directly from the park. Again, very unprofessional. These issues will probably prevent me from staying at this property again.","New, Clean Property with Some Other Issues",3

The TV is a big, nice brand new HD LG flat LED. The signal strength to the tv is so weak that the screen was incredibly dim and hard to see. The hotel does not have HD service. I don't mean to sound petty, but on a weekend away from the kids it is nice for my wife and I to come back and relax and watch a game. I played with settings and could not get it fixed.Overall, I would happily stay here again. It is consistently a great value for such a nice hotel in a premium location. They staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and taken care of.","Great Location, Great Value",4
This was my first time staying at a Holiday Inn Express. (I confess that we are usually Marriott people in general.) This will also be our last time staying at a Holiday Inn Express.

"We stayed in this hotel several times when it was a Radisson. The location is perfect for us since we are visiting family in the Marina district and we like to tour the city by public transportation. Perhaps I shopped poorly this time for a deal on a room, but we paid well over 400 per night for a room that was called a deluxe double/double. It didn't seem like a deluxe anything. Yes, it did have a partial view of the Bay but it had a much better view of the noisy parking lot and the windows of other peoples' rooms. I had asked for a quiet room and was tolf this room was quiet. Yet it turned out to be right next to the elevator. Go figure. The room had nice amenities (upscale coffee pot and coffee, a mini-refrigerator) but it was very small and cramped, even with only two of us. The bathroom needed a good cleaning. For this kind of money, I expect a room to be really clean and this one wasn't. The hotel has been renovated recently which is nice, but much of the workmanship is quite shoddy and may not hold up very well. The hotel offers no room service, no coffee service in the lobby in the mornings as best I could tell, and has no bar at all. Even given how expensive hotel rooms are in San Francisco, I expected a lot more for this kind of money. The front desk staff was very nice however. Be aware that the few elevators available are very slow and small. You might want to leave extra time to get to the lobby with luggage at checkout time.

"This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel, which means that it is geared towards business travelers. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate since we weren't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room. The hotel reminded me of a European hotel, especially since it's in an old building. The location is perfect right across the street from the River, near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it.","Great location, small but comfy rooms",4

"Overall this is a great hotel, in a terrific location. Very easy to find. The room was spacious and well appointed. The wireless access was easy and very fast. My only complaints were the in-room iron was in very poor shape and the bathtub / shower tap had a continuous trickle of water unless you turned the knob slightly over toward the ""on"" position, which is obviously counter-intuitive. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not bring this up with anyone until I was checking out. I was only staying for 2 nights and only needed the iron 1 of the mornings. My other negative was - while I was toweling off after my morning shower, I noticed a long strand of dark hair hanging off my shoulder. This was a bit gross as it clearly wasn't mine - I am pretty much bald with only a bit of ""peach-fuzz"" on the sides, which is mostly grey. It clearly must have come off the towel, which makes you wonder a bit about their laundry regime. Although, it could also have come off the cleaning staff when they were replacing the towels in the room. Either way a little ""icky"" from my perspective. However, when I brought the iron and bath tap issue up with the front desk attendant at check-out he was very apologetic and ""comped"" me a night of valet parking.",Pretty nice place,3

I will be out by 11am. I felt so pressed that I finally relented, thru all my belongings out the door and finished packing out in the parking lot. Needless to say I won't be staying there again. Other that the housekeeping pushing me out the door it was a nice stay. (I did complain at the front desk)",what was their hurry ?!?!?,4
"My husband and I stayed here during Jazz Fest in early May. The hotel isn't much to look at from the outside- it appears to be an older building. We had a king room on the 7th floor- the view was of a parking lot with graffiti on the walls. The room was perfectly adequate though- the bed was comfy, shower pressure good, and we didn't hear any noise from outside or within the hotel. Nice and quiet- we slept great. The 5:30 kickback was great! Free drinks and appetizers. I just wish it lasted more than an hour since we didn't make it back to the hotel in time each night for it. The breakfast was fresh and plentiful as well. Waffle maker, hot buffet items, juices, etc. And included in the cost of the hotel room- a great plus. The hotel was a short walk from French quarter and other areas of interest. The city bus ran close by to the hotel- we took this to the City Park and rode bikes, as well as to the Jazz Fest. The price for our room was pretty steep since it was during Jazz Fest- but we still felt like it was a good value and in line with other hotels in the area. Parking was 25 a night plus tax. The hotel is still undergoing renovations- it looks like the parking garage will be attached to the building rather than 10 minutes away which will be nice. Overall would recommend staying here- no reservations!",Would stay here again- good value in New Orleans,5
"The Vagabond is now allowing children of all ages!!! if you plan on bringing your kids, ask for one of the four corner rooms which have two double beds, (since everything else is king size beds)... otherwise you children have to sleep on one king bed..bring snacks, food and water for kids (no kids menu)... the rooms are spacious enough, just not too many drawers space (only three). full closet, blow dryer, ironing board, etc. for under 200 bucks a night, you can't beat this place!! the food is fantastic. I recommend renting a car and doing little day trips, but no matter what, there's nothing like the Vagabond pool vibe.

"Great weekend skiing in Jackson, it was below zero every night. I had the heat turned down as far as it would go and it would still kick on every once in a while. The room tended to be slightly warmer than I wanted anyway. Not the fanciest hotel, but comfortable. The way the rooms are set up you may hear people walking in ski boots on the upstairs deck and down the stairs in the mornings. Not a huge concern to me but some people may not like that.",Nice place,4

Stayed one night and visited the aquarium the next day. Nice property and the room was nice. Only issue was the pillows were awful. The lumpiest pillows (all 4 of them) I've ever had in a hotel and I travel a lot.,Short Uber ride from everything.,4
"The room was very clean. The bed was very comfortable. It's an older hotel and there is a flowery perfume in the lobby and halls, but not within the room. The rooms were all marked as nonsmoking but there was a definite residual odor. For the money and convenience, I would stay here again. I only stayed one might to catch an early flight. There is a very light breakfast selection, but it's included I The rate and meets most dietS. I went to Cracker Barrel which was 3 minutes away.",Good value for location,4

"We came downtown for my sisters bachelorette weekend and decided to stay here. What a great decision. Centrally located in the loop close to restaurants, theaters and shopping. The hotel is exquisite in its decor. The staff can not be anymore friendly and ready to accommodate you. Every evening between 5-6pm with your room key there is free Proseco or Sangria in the lobby bar area. And believe me all the guests take advantage of it. Right now they are doing a bit of construction so there are some noisy periods but besides that no complaints. Rooms decent size for downtown. Love their amenities. Bonus there is a Starbucks connected to the hotel on the first floor. I usually am not disappointed by a Kimpton property and I can add this one to the list. Great customer service and a charming art deco vibe is what we aim for! Thanks for staying with us. We work hard to make our guests happy and appreciate your feedback!",Bachelorette weekend,4

"We have stayed at this hotel many times. I think it's great for families. My son loves the small arcade, bowling alley, movie theatre, pool and Friday's restaurant. I love the fact that the rooms are large, very clean and come with a small fridge. It is also great for families to have the shower and toilet area seperate. In addition to Friday's restaurant there are other restaurants including a 24 hour cafe and an ice cream shop that stays open late as well, very convenient. There are also shopping centers near the hotel that include just about every store and restaurant you can think of, Target, PF Changs, Mimi's etc. My parents had an odd numbered room and it overlooked the pool and golf course. My even numbered room overlooked a roof, not so nice. This is really the only negative I can think of. Also, pool area has no lifeguard or supervision of any kind, so some adults got a little unruly, drinking beer in the pool, speaking loudly etc. But, overall this is a nice place to stay off the strip, especially for those traveling to Las Vegas with children.",Nice Off the Strip Hotel,4

"Great location in a historic French quarter hotel. Parts of this Inn date back to the 1700's when it was a bakery. It was eventually purchased by Baroness Pontalba (Jackson Square visionary) who turned it into an Inn to host her many friends and visitors. Each room, floor, wing are unique. We had a king deluxe room on the courtyard side that was clean, comfortable and quiet, even in carnival season. Front of the house staff very friendly. No room service or restaurant, but Pablo's coffee is next door, Cafe Du Monde is right down the street, and there are many other wonderful, near by places for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!. The courtyard is a quiet place to be outside away from the hustle of the streets, the pool is inviting but unheated.

"We stayed as part of a group. Price was very affordable and a good value for the stay. The entire hotel was very clean. I remember the bathroom being slightly aged but it was nothing to ruin our stay. Our room was a king bed, a nice size with view facing window. The window curtain was just long enough to cover the AC which would have otherwise directly blown on us, and allowing the room to cool to the right temp. The lobby is very charming, with amenities such as snacks and drinks to purchase immediately adjacent to the front desk, and a little cafe and lots of seating. The pool and hot tub are nice, very clean, and a decent size. The lounge chairs are a little overcrowded but there's plenty of seating. It's in walking distance to many shopping centers, delis, coffee shops, and grocery.You'll need your room key to get anywhere within the hotel, including back inside from the pool area.Only complaint is that the advertised check-in time is 4PM which is late.

There were only about 10 channels on the TV and nothing for kids (so I had no pool or TV for the first night after a long day of work and traveling).

"Good resort, good food and great view. First time in Cabos. Staff was friendly and the food was definitely better than most all inclusive resorts. Overall we enjoyed the stay.

Had to make reservations for most restaurants. Lots of extra charges for all inclusive packages.",Best Ocean Front Property in Cabos,4
"We decided to stay a few extra days in Vegas and found a good offer at the Suncoast, plus we wanted to spend our mornings hiking in Red Rock. The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review. Sounds like you enjoyed most of your stay, and you will be pleased we are going through a full scale remodel of our hotel rooms.

"Very well-maintained hotel with many amenities, especially for the price point: free Wi-Fi indoor pool free continental breakfast with a variety of selections. Friendly staff, immaculately clean public areas and comfortable, welcoming rooms with modern decor. Located in a Hotel Row, the Fairfield Inn Saginaw is situated within the city's main shopping cluster, so it literally sits between two shopping plazas and slightly across from the mall. Great for shopping, eating and freeway access, but not too great for view, thus the 4 versus 5 rating (my view was the parking lot of two anchor stores, Big Lots and Hobby Lobby). That's the most minor of issues, however, especially when traveling for business. I would absolutely stay here again and will recommend the hotel to others in the future.",Great Hotel for a Short or Extended Stay,5

"Traveled to Seattle from South Carolina to visit family and friends, and to see the sights. Since there were four of us we picked the Residence Inn for its location and room size. After a long cross-country flight and cross-city taxi ride, we arrived at the hotel after midnight. Although I had been told previously that the hotel was completely booked, we were immediately offered an upgrade to a larger, more accommodating room, which I accepted. My fault - I just assumed that the offer was at the same price I had previously agreed to pay for the original room since I was not informed otherwise. It was not. An email alert received after we were in the room let me know exactly how much my card had been charged,which was quite a bit more than the reserved room. Not the hotel's fault I was tired and should have been more attentive, but at that point it didn't matter. We appreciated the larger room, especially the second bedroom.The included breakfasts were excellent, the front desk personnel were extremely efficient in helping to book the two escorted tours we took, and, since we were expecting to get some exercise, the location of the hotel allowed us to walk to the Space Needle and upper downtown areas without too much complaining from the teenager. The exercise room and the indoor pool were both used. The close proximity of the REI flagship store (an easy walk) was a plus.We ate at four of the restaurants within walking distance of the hotel (two on the lake) and enjoyed an after dinner walk around Lake Union just across the street. The room was great, the extra space was definitely a plus, and the location was convenient. Overall, a good experience.Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn for your visit to Seattle. We are delighted that you enjoyed yourselves!","Nice visit, a bit pricey.",4

"Although the staff is friendly, this hotel is extremely outdated. Our room smelled horrible and the carpets were so filthy we were afraid to take off our shoes. The blankets and sheets had stains and were worn to the point of being see thru in places. In addition, the ceiling panels were falling in and the bathroom vent fan was hanging from the ceiling and didn't run. The shower allowed the temperature to go well above 140 degrees according to the controls and my son almost melted his skin off accidentally. The television was an old Mitsubishi console with white fuzz. Because we got in so late, there were no other rooms to switch to. I truly don't know how this place stays in business.

"You definitely get what you pay for. There were stains all over the floor, the bathroom was dirty and the light wouldn't come on half the time. There was one towel in the bathroom and it was paper thin - I'm so glad we brought our own. The TV didn't work at all, and in the living room there were cables on the wall where a TV should be. The door wouldn't close unless you channeled your inner Hulk and slam it as hard as you can. The people in the room above us had a very impressive stereo system - we could hear them blasting music all night long. Kids are running around everywhere and there's shouting at night. So if sleeping at night really isn't your thing, this is the place for you. Then there's the roaches. They are everywhere, so if you're afraid of bugs (like me!) avoid this place. Ew. Gross.",Yuck.,2

"This is a brand new hotel in what seems to be a newly developing area near sea world. That being said, there's a lot of construction on additional hotels right next door. Every day during our week stay, there were people working, tractors moving and beeping at the crack of dawn and late into the afternoon. Also, I shared a room with the a coworker, although I appreciate the nice design of a hanging barn door for the bathroom, I think adding a lock would've been a good call. No lock on the bathroom door is a little awkward. The track was also not level on the door so it would slowly open when you tried to close it all the way. We had to resort to wedging a towel between the door and the threshold to keep it from rolling open. That aside, the hotel has everything you need, free breakfast in the morning, business center, and a cvs close by.

"Stayed one night on a recent trip before flying out for home. The room was a little crowded with two queen beds but not a problem for such a short stay. All amenities functioned as expected including the thru-the-wall H/A/C unit which was quieter than many such units we have encountered. I did not use the Wifi that night so cannot comment on its strength, stability, etc. We were away to our flight before breakfast was ready the next morning but they did get us coffee which was good. And, the shuttle to the departure gates was right on time at 5:30 am. I can not say more about other amenities such as the indoor pool, etc. Access to the elevator is a bit cramped especially if one uses a luggage trolley.Thank you for making the Fairfield Inn/Marriott your choice hotel, we are excited that you stayed with us.

"We stayed four nights and overall we were very pleased. The staff is friendly and courteous. Check-in was easy and our room was clean and comfortable. The first night there were some loud party animals next door shouting drunkenly into the wee hours. After I called the front desk and complained, the noise died down and they weren't a problem any other night. We slept well and we had everything we needed.Breakfast was varied and plentiful. This is not a gourmet meal but it is good food (eggs, bacon, waffles, oatmeal, fruit, muffins, etc.) and we enjoyed eating by the pool in the courtyard. Very pleasant.The hotel is conveniently located at the edge of the French Quarter...away from the noise but a pleasant walk to the interior and minutes from everything. Honestly, we felt lucky to find this place. It isn't fancy, but it is very clean and fit our needs. The hotel staff answered questions and were very gracious. Check-out was easy and they held our bags. We were very happy with the location and value. The only other snafu we had was one afternoon we got back about 5:00 and they hadn't cleaned our room. Somehow the maid had skipped ours, but when we asked her to take care of it she did right away. We loved our stay and we'll be back!!Hello Ma'am,Thank you for the many kind words your shared about our property. We apologize for the mishap with housekeeping during your stay. We have added a new team member in a supervisory position to improve our tracking and service. We are glad that you otherwise felt well taken care of and sincerely thank you for your patronage!Teresa Munoz - Revenue Manager","On the edge of the French Quarter. Quiet, clean reasonably priced.

Overflow parking lot across the street has shady guys that drink and do drugs around the clock. I took the attached picture out our window at 9:00 am - twice as bad at 11:00 at night when uploading kids and bags. It was unsafe and a dangerous area at night.

"Room and bathroom were very clean, bathroom looked fairly newly remodeled. Good blackout curtains. New-ish carpet, clean. Spacious room. Beds were very comfortable, sheets were well pressed and clean, pillows were comfortable. Nice to have nice new fridge and microwave. Furniture was a little worn, but okay. Someone had been smoking in the room, and I found the cigarette smell annoying, but the moving air of the a/c covered it up pretty well. A/C worked very well. It is a fairly basic hotel, but the owners appear to put extra effort into keeping it very well-maintained and very clean. Not a bad place for an overnight stay if you want a good price - we were visiting family in Ocean City and didn't want to pay the high hotel prices there. Bring your own toiletries - the soap bars are miniscule.","Very clean hotel, decent stay.",4

It was a short overnight stay with my husband. The Hotel lobby was clean and comfortable. The pool area was under construction closed (which was NOT mentioned on their website). The work was very loud and messy. We were awakened 9am by the fire alarm and had to be evacuated. All of the guests were standing outside of the hotel for almost an hour before anyone explained what was going on. The shower had mold in the caulking.

"Located on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy day's in Venice, facility's good, staff very friendly and very helpful. I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so don't ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!",A good Hotel on the Lido - Quiet location.,5

This is a great hotel for a honeymoon. My wife and I stayed their for 1 night. The Hotel staff and service is absolutely wonderful but if you want to sleep in that is not going to happen.

To make matters even worse the vallet brought my car up front but wasn't there to give me the key as I stood out in the cold for 10 minutes. Not a good experience.P.S.

"Great for park access, nice area to queue whilst waiting for the park to open, in keeping with the general park motif - lots of pretty flowers in pots. Almost no waiting, we got straight in in September for access to the Hallowe'en Themed Park. Fairly reasonable prices for food. I believe El Paso is the only All Inclusive hotel. We stayed BB in Hotel Poraventura and had the buffet meal one day. A wide variety of food for the buffet, with a nice choice of soups, pastas, cheeses, fruits and assorted desserts. 62 with a bottle of wine - slightly higher than we had paid in Salou. BB is typical fare: hot food of 3 types of sausages, bacon, eggs, tortilla espaol, beans also available are churros, waffles, pan au chocolate cold meats such as salamis and ham fruits, such as sliced melon, watermelon, orange, peach whole fruits yoghurts. Coffee and fruit juice machines available (although it was rare to see all of these working simultaneously)! Quite a walk from Salou centre.

It's located in an industrial area with businesses and a couple of other hotels around so not sure if it serves the airport or industry, so perhaps not a place to stay unless you have local business to conduct (in our case it was the proximity to the airport).",Good value,4

What's that on the floor Housekeeping left a little souvenir behind. Don't bother paying more for executive room. Small room with only toilet and small shower in bathroom. Sink outside bathroom. Bright parking lot light at night. Told by one employee when I called the hotel that Sea World had fireworks at night so made special requests for Sea World facing room. They didn't. Breakfast eggs were of the powdered kind. No yogurt. (But then again, I can't complain - it was satisfactory and free.) Pool was basically bordered by parking lot. (Nobody used it during my stay.)

"I had two of my employees stay at the hotel form mid Sept to mid November. After coming from another hotel where there were no issues, thy began to have allergic reactions. After several thousand dollars in doctor bills we found that the room was infested with bed bugs. They moved my two employees to another room, which they had to do since they would not refund the payment, but then made them wash all their own cloths several times and made it known that the problem was not theirs but that my employees had brought them in with them. There was no compensation for the trouble or expense and the humiliation was uncalled for. So be prepared that if you stay here, that whatever goes wrong is your fault and nothing of the hotels responsibility and that you should be glad they even let you stay in their marginal hotel. I will make sure none of my employees ever stay there again. Also, tremendous noise and dust from the many construction sites around with no reduction in monthly rate due to the noise.Dear Bud PThank you for choosing us, as Weve told you before, as soon as we were notified about the situation, management were on top of the issue, and we are grateful that our pest control company was notified, checked all your luggage finding that the bed bugs were in your luggage and we were able to content and fix the situation changing you of rooms immediately.

Living room had a pull-out sofa sleeper. Room was clean. Carpet is a bit out of date but definitely not gross by any means. Wifi worked fine. Pricci (restaurant) is directly across the street. Pricy but good. Waffle House is within 1/4 mile with sidewalks and crosswalks so you can get there very easily if desired.

Hotel is nice and clean. This year they had free wifi in rooms too. This is a big change because It was a big discomfort in the yesteryears. They should better up their breakfast. Seems like the fresh fruits have disappeared. Rooms are expensive every year. Services have not improved a single bit. I have been staying here for last five years. Next year if their price goes up then I'd rather go to a five star at this price or a little higher. There are better options at higher price.,Value for money going down as price goes up,4
"We chose to stay here at the last minute, so we wouldn't have to make the two hour trek home following the comedy show we were seeing at bankers life field house. We picked this hotel because of the price and not entirely negative reviews. It pretty much lived up to its reviews. Not a great location, tucked between a wal mart and a lowes, with limited parking and a dimly lit parking lot. our room was fine and the bed was relatively comfortable. I didn't sleep well, but I blame myself for not bringing my own pillow. I can't sleep without a pillow, but I need it to be pretty flat, which hotel pillows are notoriously fluffy. My husband didn't sleep well because of the air conditioner. It was incredibly loud, which we both liked, because it drowned out the other noises in the hotel. Unfortunately, whenever the AC shut off, it was jarring and woke him up repeatedly. My only other complaints would be the room doors, which slam no matter how you shut them and the breakfast buffet, which is a healthy eaters worst nightmare (unless you can be sustained on mealy apples alone). To summarize, you get what you pay for. But this was by no means a terrible experience.","Not bad, inexpensive and close to downtown",3

"This was probably one of my least favorite hotel stays ever. The rooms were cleanish, though there was pink mold all over the shower in the bathroom. Had to ask to get the room cleaned. The pool is literally on Roosevelt Boulevard, so you cannot escape the sound of traffic driving by. Not relaxing at all. Worst though was the front desk: every time I went there there would be two people behind the desk and yet only one working, answering phones and dealing with guests at the same time. Took forever to check in, get pool towels, get an extra key... Probably would not stay here again unless desperate.Dear tdeluzuraga,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel.

We spent the week of March 11 at the hotel and had a very nice stay. We had 2 suites (one bedroom suite for my husband and I and a two bedroom suite for son and his wife and 4 children). The 2 bedroom suite was a generous size for the family of six. The one bedroom suite was very nice with a door separating the bedroom from the living/kitchen space. The rooms were neat and clean. We never experienced any problems with housekeeping. The kitchen was fully stocked and had a full size fridge. Plently of room for snacks and drinks. The weather was a little chilly while we were there so the pool was only used one afternoon. But it was well maintained. The staff was very pleasant. The breakfast was fine. We did not partake in the evening menu so we cannot comment. But it was nice to have that option. The location was close to the Disney Parks and other attractions. We would return to this hotel again.,Very nice stay,5

"I initially reserved a room, on my own, at the Knights Inn Market Center in Dallas, Texas. The booking was completely unprofessional, with errors in the booking info. This was corrected after a couple of emails. I then inquired of the cancellation policy. The explanation was first, and I quote, before 24 hours. After inquiring of the meaning of that statement, they modified it to after 24 hours!!! Complete and utter incompetence. This was in the month of January, and my reservation was in April. I then noted the charges for the room appear on my credit card statement in January!!!! I then realized the level of incompetence, and wondered if fraud may be involved. A phone call to the Inn put me in contact with a young lady, who couldn't even find a record of my reservation. She was eventually helpful in finding it and reversing the charge to my account. She also clarified verbally the cancellation policy, which was the standard prior to 24 hours before the date of the stay. After all this, I emailed about a week ago, asking them to cancel my reservation, and confirm by email. No response, so sent a second email asking again for confirmation. No response. I have again emailed, to the attention of the young lady who helped in the past, requesting confirmation of my cancellation. Ed WooleverHello Mr. Woolever, I apologize that you had some issues with your reservation. According to our records which were emailed to you upon your request, your reservation was booked for January 21st, since you failed to checkin on January 21st you were charged for the first night. When you called us to inform us about the charge and your intention to book the room on April 21st, we thought of it as a miscommunication and as a courtesy reversed the charges immediately. Later you emailed us with your intention to cancel the room for April 21st, I emailed you back requesting you to call me for the cancellation (as it is a standard protocol for most hotel reservation cancellation to get a verbal authorization), which you called and canceled within 10 minutes. We sincerely apologize for the initial date mismatch and the charge, I hope we can go pass that and you would give us an opportunity to show you our commitment to customer service by staying with us. If there is anything I can do to persuade you to change your decision please give us a call. Thank you for your feedback, your feedback is very valuable to us since it helps us improve our services.",Watch Out for This One,1

The Chelsea itself seemed very nice even thought I didn't stay in a room there. As you walk through the Chelsea and into the Annex you get a totally different feel. It goes from semi-upscale to the creepy part of the hotel in American Horror Story. The beat up squeaky elevators to dimly lit hallways and the sketchy bright red lights on every floor it screamed AHS. On the positive side the price was great for a Friday night and it was just a really short walk to the Trop. Next time I would pay the few extra dollars and stay at the regular Chelsea not the Annex.,American Horror Story,2

"Decided to stay here on a personal trip to the area, but was quickly disappointed once I lugged my suitcase up the 3 stories of the building on a rather warm Boston day. Similar to other reviews, the website invited me to belief that I would be staying at a clean, charming, BB, with privacy and antiques, but rather I experienced dusty, musty, creaky, invasive, and somewhat haunting of an experience. I had planned to stay three nights, but left after the first night because I couldn't sleep (due to the lack of AIR CONDITIONING and lack of a fan), uncomfortable bed, and the notion that a creepy crawly might crawl over my face while sleeping or showering (yes, there is a plant in the shower.) I've stayed at several BBs in the past and had lovely experiences when the hosts provide a clean, comfortable room and bathroom situation, along with friendly (not invasive and pushy) service, but unfortunately, my experience here was none of that. Once the uncomfortable night was over, I gave a chance to the breakfast served by the Innkeeper, however alongside my crepe, fruit, and bananas (no protein or bread), I received a political and religious lecture to start off my morning as well. If you're looking for a story to tell, then I'd recommend staying here, but if you're looking for a comfortable, private, quiet place to rest your head in Cambridge, I'd stay elsewhere.","Lovely exterior, but dusty and uncomfortable...",2
"The reviews of hotel are what led us to stay here. The staff was friendly and very helpful.As with everything in San Francisco it was expensive but the hotel lived up to its good reviews and was close enough to walk or ride cable car or F train to most destinations. We used shuttle from airport to hotel and never needed a car. The location is right in front of China town so very easy access and a coffee and bagel shop on every corner so quick breakfast is no problem. We stayed here on the tail end of a Maui vacation and wished we had just stayed in Maui. But this is no fault of hotel just personal preference on more relaxing vacation in Maui as compared to having to rush from point to point in San Francisco. Also Maui much more affordable that San Francisco, never would have thought that. Hotel great if this is the type vacation you desire. Great staffDear Mark,Thank you for choosing to stay with the Orchard Garden Hotel. I am pleased to find that you found our team very friendly and helpful. Our location is positioned perfectly to walk to a lot of the attractions. China Town being one since we are located right at the gates, and Union Square where there are lots of shops and restaurants in walking distance. Being in our prime location does help save on the extra expense of transportation one might occur if staying at a different property.Overall, Mark it seems you did enjoy the hotel and the service provided. If you are ever back in San Francisco we do hope you choose Orchard Garden Hotel.Thanks again,Bruce PinckneyFront Office ManagerOrchard Garden Hotel",First Time in San Francisco,4

Roaches galore!! Springs coming out of the mattress. Cigarette butts on the stove...you could see outside through our door and our AC unit.

"This is a no-frills hotel, but perfectly met our needs for our recent long-weekend. We went between UCF (15min away) and Disney (35min away) so it functioned as a perfect location. There were tons of restaurants, gas stations, and fast food places along the same road. A Walmart Neighborhood Market (grocery store for those of you who don't know) was about 10min down the road, too. The front desk staff was pleasant and check-in was easy. The 25 deposit was credited to my account immediately after checkout, too. Our room was clean and up-to-date. The towels were nice. Water pressure in the shower was also great. The mini fridge was really cold and the microwave was functional. My kids did take time to enjoy the pool, and they really liked it. It was clean and just the right temperature. Overall it was a great stay. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you for providing us with feedback regarding your most recent stay with us. It's great to hear that our property was perfect for your stay and I'm glad that you would consider staying with us again. We hope to see you soon.",Met expectations. Very happy with stay.,5
"Even though I've worked for a W property in the past, I had never stayed in one as a guest so I was super excited when we had enough points saved up for a 2 night stay at the W Seattle for our 1st anniversary. Upon arrival, Nina (super sweet and friendly) assisted us and let us know that our room was not ready yet so they stored our luggage and said they would email us when it was ready. We never received an email but headed back around 4pm and it was ready. They had defeathered the room per our SPG profile and even upgraded us to a Cool Corner Room. I was so excited! Their W Insider (concierge) had emailed us prior to the trip and asked if we were celebrating anything special. We told them it was our anniversary and he was able to upgrade us as a surprise. Along with the upgrade, was a bottle of champagne on ice and some homemade gummy bears which totally put a smile on our faces. That's hospitality at its finest. The room was super clean and the view was amazing with 4 large windows. The room also had a really nice chaise lounge that couple be separated into 2 seats or combined for 1 lounge. It was really comfy. The W mattress is also really comfy and I liked that the bed was lower to the ground. The AC was also really quiet which provided us 2 nights of really good sleep. In the evenings, they had live music in the Living Room and after 9pm they had a DJ so it was sort of a party atmosphere at night but no noise could be heard from the room aside from city street noise. Overall, we had a great experience. The staff always greeted us when we walked by and the valet guys always opened the doors for us. I hope to visit again soon!PS- it's a 6 block walk to Pike Place Market. No need to rent a car as everything was within walking distance. WOW, thank you for sharing about your recent visit 882triciam, we appreciate the opportunity to be part of such a special event! It sounds like you were able to take advantage of our location to check-out everything Seattle has to offer, including some live local music in the Living Room.

"Back Bay is an excellent place to stay in Boston, and this hotel is lovely. Don't expect mod cons, although you have everything you need. The rooms are decked out with lovely antique furniture, enormous marble bathrooms and delicious cookies and a continental breakfast included (also they have a coffee machine that makes reasonable strong coffee that's good to get you going in the morning). I stayed in a single room that shared a bathroom with one other room. The room was small, with a single bed, but the bed was comfortable and big enough for one. I peeked into one of the double rooms one day I was there and it was enormous with a private bathroom, so if you want to spend the extra cash, or if there's more than one, then that would be a good option. The service was pretty minimal, but then I didn't really need anything while I was there, and when I did speak to the staff they were friendly enough. The area is a short walk to downtown, and you have lots of excellent cafes, shops and restaurants in Back Bay. My top tip for food and shops is Newbury Street. A lovely tree-lined street with old brownstones converted into shops, cafes and restaurants. Walking from one end to the other, near the public gardens end is all up-market designer stores, but keep walking and you go past the usual round of high street stores before hitting the funky end a bit further on.",Great boutique hotel in a lovely part of town,5

"Now like most reasonable people whove traveled a lot, we understand when you make a special request, motels cant always meet them. Were okay with that.What were not okay with is when motel proprietors make up silly excuses to avoid honoring advertised claims. And were also not okay with being threatened with refusal of service. Thats exactly what happened to us here.This was to be our 36th hotel stay in almost six months of travel across North America, and our first experience with the Motel 6 chain. It will also be our last.We booked a week prior to our stay through the Motel 6s national website, requesting a room with a fridge in our booking comments. The national (mobile) website lists an amenity for this motel as Free microfridge/some rooms. We received a confirmation booking email from Motel 6, showing our rate and our request.We read the statement Free microfridge/some rooms as some rooms (not all), have free mini-fridges. On check in, we were presented with a credit card charge that exceeded the amount in our confirmation email. On querying the difference, it was firstly explained as sales tax. Now whilst we mightnt be actuaries, even we could see the difference far exceeded any sales tax value and on querying further it became obvious there was a charge for the fridge. Sometimes misunderstandings and miscommunications occur. And were reasonable people willing to overlook issues if theres a valid explanation or compromise. This motel refused to honor the free part of the statement, offering that to us for an additional charge and suggesting that as it wasnt their personal website, there was no obligation on them to do so. The comedy routine got better though.We were asked for and provided evidence of our booking, and of the statement on the Motel 6 website (it was more a demand as in what website says that). The gentleman we dealt with was not prepared to compromise on this point however. He was insistent on making his point, which simply was that the rate in his computer system for rooms with fridges, was a higher rate.That he was rude, threatening and unwilling to compromise on such a minor point, and with such unreasonable excuses made us wonder if we were on one of those reality comedy shows you know the ones where people are deliberately rude and antagonistic, and then the camera crew rushes out and surprises you and everyone laughs. We saw no camera crew however and the comedy routine continued with him suggesting we cant just give things away. In our view, and for most other reasonable people, failing to honor advertised claims amounts to misleading and deceptive conduct. Giving an unreasonable excuse to disassociate a chain-branded property from its national brand simply to avoid honoring a small commitment demonstrates a lack of integrity. We also contacted Motel 6s national office via their website about our issue. On the first occasion they misread our concern, seeing it simply as being we asked for a fridge and didnt get one. On the second occasion, we received exactly the same worded, trained-monkey, form-letter response including (the almost condescending): the experience as you described, concerns us deeply. And the promised action on both counts Well send your comments to our Management Team for their review. Interpreted as were not going to do anything with your comments but hey, thanks for wasting your time and effort!We dont appreciate or accept this type of behaviour, and chose to take our business elsewhere. And were no longer waiting for the camera crew to appear.",Waiting for the reality tv camera crew suprise,1

"The hotel is very out-dated - it had the felling of going to Catskill, NY for family vacation in the 50s. I was told that it was family owned for sixty years and I am sure that not many changes have been made during that time. It's hard to say what needs to be done - it was fine for us people who still remember 60s but our children were a little bit disappointed that kitchen and other amenities were not updated. Rooms were clean, cleaning service was friendly and responsive however everything looked rugged, old and lacked any charm. Too bad because the place is located in beautiful part of Carmel Valley. On the other hand if it exists for 60 years people must find it attractive and I wish the owner(s) good luck with this place for the next 60 years.",located close to town center,4

"This is an old historic hotel, with the expected creaky floors, but it was also just a little musty and had dirty carpet. If the French Quarter is your scene, but you don't want to be right on the loud vomit-filled Bourbon street then this is a very good choice. The location is on the edge of the Quarter, within easy walking distance of the party, Jackson Square, the French Market, and many great restaurants. Some of the rooms here are very small, while others are quite large. We wanted a balcony, but accidentally booked a sun deck room, which is nothing like a private balcony. The sun deck is a large communal patio with several rooms opening out to it, and it has tall concrete walls with no view, and burning hot sun. This room was very small, with no windows, and so we asked for another room. Even though it was our fault that we booked the wrong type of room the staff was incredibly friendly and accomodating, and they moved us to a room with a balcony - luckily one was available because we were staying during the week and not the weekend. All of the balcony rooms look out over the garden patio, and not the street, but the room was very large and bright. The garden area is small but pleasant, and we did enjoy sitting out there for our morning coffee. The free breakfast here is very minimal - breads, coffee, and cereal, so it is good for a quick bite, but certainly not something to look forward to. One of the best things about this place is the staff. Incredibly friendly and helpful. Everyone is willing to answer questions, and they do it with a smile and without ever acting like they expect a tip. Of course we did tip, and they were always very genuine in their appreciation. We got great recommendations for restaurants within walking distance - one was Irene's, a popular creole restaurant with great food and a fun atmosphere, but a very long wait and the other restaurant we enjoyed was Sylvain which is a small funky place with great food. Also within easy waking distance we enjoyed Mr. B's Bistro for lunch, and a glass of wine at the Carousel Bar in the Hotel Monteleone. These are all nice places for sober or semi-sober grown ups, free of loud drunks wearing beads.While the French Quarter was interesting, one day was more than enough for me. It is not the fault of the Bienville House, but the whole Quarter smells of rotting garbage and other unpleasantries. While I enjoy a drink or two, Burbon Street had absolutely no appeal to me, full of 20-somethings walking down the street yelling, carrying their giant beers/drinks, covered in beads, and this starts at 10am. If that is for you, enjoy, but I didn't need more than 10 minutes of that, so if I were ever to return to NOLA I would most definitely stay in the beautiful Garden District - there are many beautiful historic hotels here, and if you stay on or near St. Charles Street you are near the cable street car and can easily get to the Quarter whenever you want. The Garden District also has many excellent restaurants, and is close to Magazine Street, which is where the real shopping is, assuming you want something other than t-shirts with obscene sayings on them.The Bienville House is a nice place, which could use some upgrades, and it is perfect if you want to spend your time in the French Quarter, but somewhat away from the worst of it. We loved the friendly and helpful staff here, and did enjoy many good things within walking distance. However, if non-stop drinking isn't your scene I would recommend looking into the Garden District - much more peaceful and beautiful, and an easy cable car ride to the Quarter when you want it.","Nice place, but would do the trip differently",4
My kids refused to stay at the hotel because of stuffy room. We also did not feel safe and comfortable with all the hotel non-guests hanging around the front entrance at a downtown hotel.,Stuffy room. Carpet needs to be changed. Bathroom,1
"This property is a little dated. it is after all a hostel so you get what you pay for.

"I booked Jacksonville Plaza Hotel because of the cruise package: motel, free parking and round trip shuttle to Port Jax. The staff was excellent and accommodating.

Will stay again when I cruise out of this port.",Pre Cruise stop,3

"I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel.",Do Yourself a Favor and Stay At Another Hotel!,1

It has water stains on the wall and ceiling, smelled moldy, had mold spots on the curtains, and they could not have made the bathroom and smaller. At the swimming pool they gave you towels to use that weren't big enough for my 5 6 year old grandson's. And to top it all off it was not inexpensive.",Go elsewhere,2
"The beds were comfortable and the breakfast was above average with fruit and yogurts.

"The hotel was easy off and on the highway, and reasonably priced, which were our main points for selection. The night clerk was very helpful for our issue. But that doesn't outweigh the huge negative of finding a condom wrapper between the sheets with suspicious spots on the blanket, which led us to believe they had not been changed from a prior guest. Upon my request, both were replaced and we were offered a different room, but inspection of this room included holes in both the sheets and blanket. Disgusting. If I hadn't booked on line I would have insisted on my money back. We would never recommend this hotel to anyone!",Disgusting,2

"The Orchard Garden is terrific hotel in a fantastic location. Walking distance to the top of Nob Hill, while also an easy walk to the Ferry Building. Nice people, excellent service. Very comfortable beds and quiet, spacious room. Reasonable price under 200 over the weekend, too. I didn't visit the restaurant, nor use the fitness equipment. Spent time in the city instead. I would only recommend one thing: the rooftop terrace could benefit from some improvement. In my opinion, if you do a rooftop space, it should make guests feel comfortable and be an oasis within the city. See Hotel Vitale in SF or Hotel Giraffe in NY. Great rooftops. When we visited the Orchard Garden's rooftop at night, the lighting didn't work. It also didn't have much landscaping and wasn't very inviting overall. It didn't even really fit with the the atmosphere for the rest of the hotel. But, I really like this hotel overall and it will get my first call for my next visit. Everything else was great and price and location are hard to beat.","Wonderful Stay in the City, with minor suggestions",4
"The staff is nice enough and the room cleanish but still sub par compared to the Motel 6 next door. It appears that there is someone living out of their car in the parking lot. I can't fault this hotel for being crappy as the price was a bargain but I do fault Expedia for misrepresenting this as a 2+ star hotel (Mystery Hotel crappy hotel, buyer beware ). Expedia is the worst, I am so done with them.",A bit sketchier than the Motel 6 next door.,2

There has to be a better way to accommodate pet lovers and those who are not. Disappointed for sure - we were there for a wedding.",Too many dogs,4

ANY place should at least have clean sheets and not sheets filled with stains, and all different old sheets that had never been washed. A complete disguiting example of a hostel. Apalled. Oh and if you see good reviews..TRUST me its because the writers are proably backpackers (that are prob 16 and have never left home) and were absiolutley drunk and looking to party and they stayed here because they got free beer.

"After returning from Chicago and a stay at the Hotel Allegro, celebrating my partner's birthday, I can't say enough good things about the hotel. While our check-in was a little rocky with a staff member who was a bit terse ( though solely trying to deal with what seemed to be a security issue), overall our stay was great. Staff even had candies, nuts and beer in the room, with a hand-written card waiting for us in our room, as a birthday gift for my husband. The hotel has recently been updated but stays true to its Theater district roots. Modern Art Deco design adorns throughout, while still giving this hotel an old world classy feeling.

"The hotel staff were very friendly and capable. Our room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located to shops, restaurants, and the highway, but very difficult to access from the road you have to go down several blocks and turn around and come back instead of being able to turn in directly from the road. My main issue was that the room was not very clean. The towels and bathroom floor both contained hair that didn't belong to any of us there were visible stains and debris on the bathroom floor and candy wrappers on the floor under the desk, and what looked like ground-in food on the desk chair.Dear LCF22974,Thank you for taking the time to give our business the Wingate by Wyndham Atlanta Galleria feedback.

After checking in, I went to my room and about 10 minutes later the front desk lady called to make sure everything was in good working condition. I thought that was very considerate of her, seeing as I have stayed at 5 star hotels without getting that phone call. It could have been a bit cleaner around the edges so-to-speak, but when staying at a budget-friendly facility, you expect that the tops of the curtains may be a bit dusty or the baseboards a bit roughed up.

The ooms were situated so that it was not a problem and we didn't hear a sound. The beds were outstanding and I slept great (which is rare for me at hotels). The only downside was the lack of restaurants and the neighborhood. Because its right off the highway the management doesn't have a lot of control over the kind of characters in the area.

"I stayed here recently for a business trip. The pros: location, food, nice rooms and amenities (comfortable bed, hot water, quality soap, shampoo and body wash, in room coffee). Most of the staff is great. I had a bit of a scratchy voice when I misplaced my room key and the front desk guy handed me a bottle of water and told me it sounded like I needed it which was so thoughtful and above and beyond. Kudos to the staff! I ate almost all my meals here, and was very impressed by the food. The cons: when I checked in they told me they could not find my reservation (I was part of the group). People spell my last name wrong a lot so I asked them to check that as well and she said that it was not listed under the incorrect spelling either. I wound up having to go to another hotel because the hotel was booked which was very inconvenient. Turns out they did have my last name spelled wrong, and the front desk clerk must not have checked throughly or cared. The next day I found out they had me listed as a no-show. All the other employees I met were super friendly helpful and thoughtful. I was able to check in the second night as another group had left and my company figured out the error. Since the rooms face the atrium, it can be a bit noisy especially if there's a function downstairs.Overall, I would stay here again, just the check in process was disappointing and made things very inconvenient for me for the first day I was in Atlanta for my conference. I am so sorry for the error in finding your reservation. I will share your feedback with my team and appreciate you taking the time.",Nice hotel,4

"I had read the reviews, and expected a certain level of disrepair being this is an older building. The desk staff is very pleasant, the courtyard when you walk up is cute. The room is a nightmare. I wish I could add photos. The only chair was very wobbly, we never sat on it. When I sat up against the headboard, my shirt stuck to it. The kitchen had huge cracks radiating out all over the wall. The bathroom ceiling had little mold spots over the shower as there was no ventilation. The toilet seat used to be white, but was worn down to the wooden base in most spots. The white shelf over the bathroom sink was literally shredding apart. It looked like an asbestos base that had been soaking in water for a year. It was literally puffing up from inside out. It was a cheap place to stay, but not so cheap that they can't fix basic problems. The neighborhood is right by the key arena. You can walk to the space needle, public transportation is easy from here. A few nights there won't kill you, but you aren't going to want to spend much time in the room!",ICKY,2

"Booked the hotel due to the price and proximity to New Orleans. The location was right off the freeway with a Gas station and Waffle House within walking distance. Up the freeway an exit or two is a Walmart, and strip mall with several dining options nearby. The hotel itself is slightly dated but I really only felt this way due to the bathroom, which had a sliding door that made me nervous about not being able to open it, and an old shower, but it had great water pressure and temp so no complaints. They offered breakfast in the morning but I never tried it. They did allow us to check in several hours early without any advanced notice which was unexpected and very much appreciated. My one real complaint is this, apparently there was some kind of ongoing issue with the phone causing it to ring in certain rooms but the line would go dead whenever you answered it, well we didn't find this out until the middle of the night after several hang ups. We called the front desk and they advised us to unplug the phone which we did, only to discover at 2am the next night that housekeeping had plugged the phone back in. While I was not overly bothered it did have my girlfriends nerves on edge.",Phantom Phone Calls,3

It had a gorgeous french window with a juliet balcony right off the Rue du Lafayette - so charming! The shower was HUGE with a rain shower head, super nice to come back to at the end of a long day. The hotel staff was TOP NOTCH. All of the people at the front desk were extraordinarily friendly, and very helpful with recommending restaurants, ordering cabs, etc. The wonderful front desk staff made our stay! I would definitely go back to the Hotel Eugene en Ville with my husband - it would be super romantic for a couples' trip too!",LOVED this hotel!!,5
"We chose this hotel because it got fairly good reviews on Expedia and we needed a place to stay near the airport for an early morning flight. The room was much smaller than anticipated the bathroom was tiny with bath towels that were thin and so undersized that they were only slightly larger than hand towels. The room was clean,however, and we slept ok. Our biggest complaint was that we did not get the wake-up call we asked for and the airport shuttle was more than 15 minutes late. The person at the front desk was dismissive, saying that she ordered the call and that was all she could do and that the shuttle driver would be there. Thank heavens we woke on our own and had given ourself a 30 minute cushion in addition to the two hours that we had planned for our international flight. We do not recommend this hotel. There are plenty of other options.",Disgusting Black Molded room,2
"As a Miami native who comes back and visits 2-3 times a year, staying at the Mandarin Oriental Miami was a magical experience. They were able to get me to forget about terrible Miami traffic and attitudes. My entire stay I didn't have a care in the world because I knew their staff was already a step ahead of me, anticipating my needs. The Mandarin Oriental Miami was an incredible selection for our wedding stay. Our groomsmen got ready there the day of our wedding and by the time we returned that evening, the staff had cleaned up the room. This was especially great because we had given the groomsmen gifts in wooden crates (mancrates.com) and the staff made sure to get rid of all of them. They were always kind, courteous, friendly, and helpful. Valet always asked if we needed help with instructions, helped with bags, and told us about calling for your car before heading down. In-room dining was fantastic. We decided to have in-room breakfast on our final morning there. They arrived on time, set up a beautiful table by the window which even had a fresh rose on it, and rearranged furniture for the best setup. Turndown service was a delight. Coming home every night to slippers by the bed and a note with weather info for the next day was such a nice touch. We ordered champagne our first night in and were so tired we didn't get around to drinking it. Every day they refilled our champagne bucket with fresh ice during housekeeping so we always had the option to crack it open. The pool and hot tub were clean and a perfect temperature. The poolside bar had attentive and respectful service. They leave you with a button you can use to call them over. They also passed around fresh smoothie samples about once an hour. The room was spacious, clean, and modern. We stayed in one of their Dynasty Suites, which felt like being in an apartment. There was even a half bath in the living area which helped when at one point we had 8 men in the suite.",Service fit for royalty. Can't wait to go back!,5

"I will combine 2 stays into one review. My family I stayed at the OPI in an Ocean front room and 2 weeks later my 3 year old son and I came back for a dudes week together. The hotel continues to live up to expectations in every way and I think we have now stayed here 5 times with each one being a great experience.The location is amazing and the views from the OF rooms are awesome. The pool area is great for the kids to play in, the continental breakfast is good and the recently updated bathrooms are a nice touch. But the real reason we keep coming back is the staff and how were are made to feel like home here. The staff (especially Benny these two stays) are so helpful and pleasant that it feels like we are coming home each time we check in and that attitude helps the relaxation start when we walk into the lobby. I would write more but now I am going to check their availability for a return visit....Thank you so much for your wonderful recognition of our amenities and service! It is our pleasure to continue welcoming you back and we are so glad to be your second home here at The Ocean Park Inn!",Still My Favourite,5

"Ok, I have stayed here many times over the years. I have never had an issue, are they strict yes but if I was running a motel I would probably be too. Very nice pool and they keep it very clean.

"This was a decent hotel with a good-sized, clean guest room and airy public spaces, as well as a pool. It was easy to find near the highway exit, in a area where you can take a safe walk.

"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites Napa. The staff were very friendly and the facilities were excellent. There is a free buffet breakfast, wine tasting from 5-6pm and a tea/coffee station in reception all day. The pool is heated and the outdoor areas are really well maintained. I had a very relaxing stay and would definitely recommend it.Dear ACNolan,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We are very honored to have earned your recommendation and thankful you enjoyed your stay with us. It's great to hear that you had a relaxing time with us and we hope to see you again soon.

Nice hotel great beds very comfy outdoor pool hot tub close to lots of restaurants,Nice and super comfy hotel next to the beach,4
We stayed a Friday to Monday and was a little put off by the Club music coming from the bar attached to the lobby but overall it was a nice stay. I loved how relaxed they were at the pool area so we could enjoy ourselves instead of feeling gawlked at. It must be a state law but I found it odd they had a lifeguard on duty for such a small pool but he was cool and pretty much stayed to himself the whole time. I didn't like the area and it was a hassle to get on the highway. I probably wouldn't stay there again but I didn't have a bad experience.,Ramada Inn weekend stay,3
this place was nasty. there were ants in my room and my father in law clogged the toilet. not enough towels and the front desk guy seemed like he hated his job. the lobby restroom was disgusting...it had hair on the toilet and dead bugs on the floor. avoid this place.

When I asked for compensation, I was told, no, we are in renovation. I heard a lady complain about some maintenance issues she had submitted some days earlier. The front desk told her that they do not know about it! The communication is pure in this hotel. Last time, I booked a room at this hotel, the told me, on my arrival, there is no room free, but they have send me a confirmation for the room reservation.",What Surprise,2
"Friendly desk clerk gave me clear directions to my room and how to use the wifi. The clean room with fridge and microwave was a pleasure, the price a bargain.

I only wish more or the exercise room equipment worked.",I'll be back,4

Which doesn't make much sense since they are both about the same distance from the hotel. The room had a fridge and a separate sitting area which was nice. The bed was standard which for us wasn't very comfortable. They offered a free breakfast with eggs, sausage, waffles and for two days they had potatoes but didn't on the last day. They also had the standard cereal, yogurt, etc. The hotel is right next to a Jack in The Box and across the highway from and IHOP. Overall it was a nice standard hotel.",Nice Standard Hotel,4

After checking in, we went up to our room to find it hadn't been cleaned. Better luck with the second room, but the sheets were old and had stains, as did the comforter and bed skirt. The housekeeping staff didn't change our sheets during our 3-night stay. Made us wonder if they had ever changed the sheets, frankly.

There was no signage for where the pickup was to meet the shuttle.

Stayed at the Marriott for one night to go to the United Center for the Mary J Blige Concert. The staff was amazing and very accommodating. We dined in the hotel and ate handcrafted burgers and fries that was very delicious.The most accommodating part of our stay was the shuttle to and from the United Center. The driver drove us directly to the entrance of the stadium. The concert let out at 12pm and the driver was waiting or us!!!! The shuttle normally only runs until 9pm I believe but if they have guests that are attending an event the offer shuttle service too then they will stay available until the event is over.

Indoor basketball and tennis court as well outdoor tennis courts just to name a few. Even has a lap pool (not sure if it was olympic size though). All gears and equipment are provided free of charge so no need to bring racquets, balls and even shoes. Just make sure to wear or bring socks but worry not as they sell socks if you happen to forget. We all enjoyed our stay. From my wife getting pampered inside their spa for most of the time to me and our teenage kids working a lot of sweat playing all sorts of sports. The only thing that was somewhat awkward for us was that their recreational pool was filled wth mostly small kids and toddlers with their Soccer Moms or the Rich Wives of Beverly hills type of women. Not really encouraging for a full grown man who likes to drink his cold beer by the pool or teenage kids/young adults doing their horsing around or whatever. Their lap pool is always occupied and Waiting a while for a lane to be vacant somewhat takes the fun out of it.

"My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago.","Great hotel, great service, great everything.",5

"We could NOT have asked for a better hotel for our 5 night stay in Paris. Upon arrival, we were greeted so warmly. We splurged on this trip, and got a superior room with a private terrace. I would HIGHLY recommend this room. We absolutely loved sitting out on the terrace - even though the weather was less than ideal for April/May. We still took full advantage. The room was small, but that is the European way! We were expecting a smaller room than we are used to in the States, so I actually thought it was bigger than I was envisioning it to be. It was a bit odd that the toilet was separate from the shower and sink, but worked well for us as a couple. We both thought the king size bed was so comfortable! Some added bonuses to the room: Loved the waterfall shower, loved the lighting (reading light on each side of bed controlled by a switch right above the bed), there are speakers for the TV in the shower/sink room so could listen to news as I was getting ready, and the towel warmer was also a plus! The included breakfast buffet each morning was also an unexpected luxury! We didn't think we had included breakfast, and it was an amazing spread! It was pretty much the same each morning, but we never went hungry... The entire staff were all so helpful and attentive. Always greeting with a smile and hello, and always willing to give directions or guidance on what to do or where to go. This hotel is in the 9th, and we couldn't have chosen a better hotel Or area for our stay!",Excellent hotel in the 9th!,5

"We booked this hotel online the day before our 3 night stay. Although we booked on a discounted online site, we still found the price to be quite high, but all the hotels in San Francisco were quoting high prices at the time. I had been watching prices for our dates for a month or so and never found a reasonable deal in SF. It seems that hotel prices in San Francisco have risen significantly recently and with a 16 tax on hotel stays in the city, the prices are higher still. That said, we LOVED the location of this hotel. It was close to the Moscone Center where my husband was attending a conference and close to the Museum of Modern Art and Ferry Building which I visited. We had a car, but just kept it in the hotel garage and used Uber to get around for longer distances during our stay. Using Uber was quick, convenient, and the one reasonably priced thing we found in San Francisco. The charge for valet parking at the hotel garage was 49 per day, lower than prices for valet parking that we had seen at some other SF hotels. There was not a self parking option at the hotel garage, although there were public garages not far away that had a 36 per day rate. The hotel garage appeared a safer and more secure option to us, knowing that there is a high rate of car break-ins in SF (see a recent NY Times article about this). The staff at the hotel were helpful and very friendly, always greeting us pleasantly as we came and went. The bed in our room was very comfortable, the wifi worked well enough, and after asking, we were able to add more devices to the wifi for no additional charge. There was a coffee machine in the room, but it was only stocked with one capsule of caffeinated coffee and one capsule of decaf. When I asked for additional capsules, they brought them to our room, but I had to ask each day and at the price we were paying I would think they could have offered at least 2 caffeinated capsules per room. I found that I really needed the caffeinated version after being woken up numerous times, starting at 3am by garbage trucks and other loud street noise. Our room faced the street, and I'm guessing that this wouldn't be a problem with a room facing the inner courtyard. I would happily stay at this hotel again if I could get a quieter room facing the inner courtyard. The location is just hard to beat.Dear swissmiss001,Thank you very much for taking time and submitting a review after your stay at Galleria Park Hotel. Not only are we appreciative of your review, but our future guests will benefit form it as well!To begin, I would agree with your statements about our location. Being in such close proximity to the convention center is great, however that also means we are very close to some of the most well known SF landmarks. Valet parking is a great service our guests enjoy as it means that they do not have to go through the hassle of finding parking in our congested city. For future reference, if street noise is a concern please request an interior facing room - as we wish our guests to be as comfortable as possible.We are very appreciative of the compliments of our staff and hope to see you return on your next trip to San Francisco.Sincerely,Jordan Whitney","Great location, friendly staff, but room facing the street was noisy",4
"Lovely hotel but some annoying downfalls. 1. We were not advised of the check-out time which was unusually early, 10am. So as we were still relaxing in the room, housekeeping kept attempting to gain access to the room - still never mentioning that we should have checked out at 10am. I had to call the reception to ask them why we were being constantly bothered by housekeeping, only then did we find out the crazy early check out time. Very annoying!!!!!!! 2. There was no bar at the hotel but we were able to purchase wine from the lobby shop. After we ordered what we wanted and went to the room, the reception called to advise that the only red wine they now had was the most expensive one (almost double the others!) Very annoying !!! The hotel itself was nice, great location and nice pool area but the service was not great - maybe because it was out of season...",Nice hotel but not great service,4

Room was too hot but no airconditioning (this is centralised and is only turned on at a certain time during the year). You could heat the room or turn the heating off but to cool the room down wehad to keep the window door open which was a security issue. The hotel is cheaply constructed and thus the walls are paper thin and the family next door was very noisy so this affected our sleep each night. The breakfast was very standard without any frills - e.g. no fresh juices just orange and pineapple made up from concentrate powder etc. The food on offer in the hotel restaurants in the evening was also very limited and unappetising. I would recommend staying elsewhere and just buying day passes for the theme park.,Port Misadvertura,2

It is true that the AC was kind of moldy smelling and the room did feel a bit run down and the guests, in general, didn't seem real classy. The immediate location isn't exactly romantic either, but it is well located for driving places in San Diego. The breakfast, by the way, was surprisingly good. If you are used to decent hotels, it will be hard to feel comfortable at this one, and I don't think you would choose this place for a honeymoon.

"When we arrived to the room our beds were not queen sizes. I been to many hotels and I know what a queen bed size is. These beds were double sizes. We also selected for city view. As you can see in the photo I posted this is not city view. It was a view of trees and the parking lot. We contacted the front desk and spoke to the supervisor Faustino who gave the worse customer service.He said yes I can see how our website can be misleading. He said they can upgrade if we pay for it. REALLY!!! We asked for a roll out bed since the beds were small we wouldn't fit comfortably and he said no they can't because we already have two beds in the room. They brought us sheets so one of us had to sleep on the floor. The room had hair all on the bathroom walls, cracks in walls were just painted over, and sheets had stains. When we reserved for the shuttle the lady in the front desk advised us to meet in the front at 3:10pm and the driver will take us. We arrived on time in the front and we waited and waited eventually I went inside to advise them we're still waiting. It was Faustino who was at the front desk and he told me well it's a complimentary shuttle it's not guaranteed. I advised him we spoke to the lady earlier that day who took the information down for our reservation and she gave it to the driver and how can you ensure a customer of this service, we follow the directions given and than tell us it's not guaranteed. This is wasting a customers time. This was the worse stay and serv",DO NOT stay here,1

"Conveniently located close to the airport. Disappointed in the daily room service in that coffee packets and drinking cups were not replaced when consumed. The urn marked Hot Water at breakfast is not hot. Cold oatmeal on day one meant that I had to nuke all further water to ensure it was hot. Overall, not bad, just could have been a lot better if customer service was taken more seriously.",Could be better,2
"The hotel staff was friendly and prompt with the reservation. He knew who I was upon arrival and was prepared with the Hotel.com quote. The hotel room was great size for the price, the beds were comfortable, one king/one full. The bedding seemed not the cleanest and the room seemed slightly run down with paint peeling slightly. It was a great room for staying the night and hanging out at the beach, right across for the beach with parking included with the stay. So much to see and do, didn't use anything in the room TV, Phone, etc. good place to crash in between hanging out at the beach.","Fireside by the boardwalk, worth the stay.",3

"Staff and service make this property excellent! Beyond friendly and accommodating. Shuttle driver called me twice with updates on his status due to rush hour traffic delays and he was only 10min past original plan. It's a lovely 100 year old hotel downtown but updated in key furnishings like bathroom, shower, awesome beds in spacious rooms (even the basic king room). Only 2 hotels (cheaper but yuck) closer to airport and this one will now always be my choice to stay again! Outside of rush hour, it's barely 10min to airport-very convenient. The restaurant food is outstanding--they're somehow connected with a culinary institute so menu isn't vast but quality everything.

The room was quiet as requested and included a safe, coffee maker, refrigerator (which was a surprise), flat screen TV, hair dryer, alarm clock, and complimentary WiFi which connected right away. The room and bathroom were immaculate except for a gum wrapper in the nightstand drawer. The clerk at check in was a bit abrupt when I asked about getting airline miles with the room (he didn't answer my question) but the clerk at check out was very friendly. A Ruby Tuesday restaurant is right across the parking lot. The complimentary breakfast buffet included cereal, sausage, muffins, bagels, yogurt, scrambled eggs, and sliced fruit.

"I had no expectations in coming to San Diego. I had visited the city 17 years prior and remembered it being beautiful, but I never made it to Old Town. My one goal for the couple of days we had there was to enjoy some Mexican Food. Well, did we come to the right place or what. The Best Western is situated on the side of the hill with a view of the city and the Pacific. It is like a maze and due to low season there were not a lot of people on the property. It felt like we had the place to ourselves. There is a heated pool and a hot tub which are lovely especially at night. We had two amazing experiences regarding the restaurant Acapulco when we were there. Our first night we arrived after a long day of traveling and we were exhausted and starving. It said in our room book that the restaurant closed at 10pm. I looked at the clock and it was 10:01. I called to ask if there was any chance of getting food. They brought us a HUGE platter of amazing Mexican food and a 6-pack and the total was only 70!!! I was so happy. The next morning for breakfast we went to Acapulco again and were greeted by the very friendly staff. The table next to us had a coupon which they couldn't use for some reason so after they left the waitress applied the coupon to our bill without our knowledge and saved us over 20.00 We were blown away. The room was huge and fit our group of 5 comfortably. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and they even gave my daughter a lovely Christmas gift from under the tree. It is a one minute walk to the main drag in old town and two minutes to a lovely park up the hill. Also the hotel is very close to the transit system and the State park (which is really cool).Thank you for brining attention to the warm responsive service you received while staying with us. Indeed, Old Town boasts some of the best Mexican fare in all of San Diego. Acapulco is a great choice for any meal we are grateful to have them right on our property. Overall, I am happy that we exceeded your expectations and delighted you with our central location!",What a beautiful property in a super cool neighbourhood,5

"Spent one night here after travelling from Orlando through the Everglades and the Keys. Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback. So glad you enjoyed your visit to our property and had an excellent first impression. The team does an amazing job maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, and getting our guest checked in quickly so they can enjoy the Island. Thanks for staying with us.

"We traveled from CA to Fond du Lac for my father's funeral services. I made this reservation on Hotels.com because we needed a trusted hotel name since we would be traveling with our 1 year old baby. No where was it disclosed that this Holiday Inn was undergoing MAJOR renovations. Neither hotels.com, nor the hotel itself informed us at check in that our room was literally one foot away from a hallway that was in shambles with the entire length of the hallway rug removed, concrete floors covered with debris including nails, shards of hard and soft lastic, and crumbled foam, sealant and other hazards. This was all going on with exit doors ajar and workers coming in and out of the hotel in the dead of winter with snow and 10 degree weather.

"First the bad - you get what you pay for, the building old and the lifts are rickety - one of those lifts where your not sure if you will make it up to your floor or not! The safe isn't electronic so you need to go to the reception pay 5 and get a key. Slightly worryingly the receptionist told me they only have a certain number of keys for the safes. As mentioned the streets close by are full of homeless, drunks and junkies. That said, there isn't too much the hotel can do about that.The rooms are not too bad, enough space and have a walk-in wardrobe to hang your clobber.

"Having visited San Diego before and not necessarily enjoying the Gas Lamp District (with it's chain restaurants and conference going visitors), I was excited to discover the hip Pearl Hotel in Point Lomo. When you tally up it's affordable price, friendly customer service, inviting bar and pool area, and overall design, it's clear you have an excellent choice when staying in San Diego.The hotel is a short five minute drive from San Diego Airport, about fifteen minutes to downtown or Balboa Park, and conveniently located next to a Starbucks, grocery store, and the harbor on Shelter Island. Limited on-site parking is available for a reasonable 10 a night although it's probably best to ask the hotel to reserve a spot for you.The hotel itself is a converted motel with just over 20 rooms situated around a small pool. The main check-in area and bar feature a hip lobby and modern looking bar which also serves as a place to grab a bite to eat in the evening and a cup of coffee in the morning.The rooms while retaining that mid-century motel layout are remodeled with clean bathrooms, a comfortable bed, and a trendy design. A nice twist is that each room features a goldfish which adds a nice human touch. Our first floor room let in a little more noise than I expected from the common areas, but by midnight when staff were tidying up and closing the bar, there was little noise to keep you up.While we did run into an issue during our stay, the staff were extremely helpful and pro-active in making sure we left on a good foot. Had they stopped there, I would still have written a positive review but their follow up call and gesture proves that this is a well managed hotel that truly cares about their customers.On behalf of the entire Pearl management and staff, thank you for taking the time to leave a kind and detailed review! We truly appreciate it. Your support means the world to us. Please come visit us again soon. Tell a friend.","Well run, customer-centric mid-century modern motel!",4

"As a business traveller it was important to me that the Wif-Fi worked. It was really atrocious. It was actually easier to join the network if a neighbouring hotel but of course I had no password. The wi-fi also doesn't support SSL so it's a very hackable (i.e. not secure) connection. When I checked in there was nobody on the desk for about 10 minutes, forcing me to wait with my colleague in a taxi outside. The room itself was OK but there were stains on the carpets and the suite consisted of two single beds which was very disappointing. The TV has only German channels. I closed my window before going out because it was cold but when I returned someone had opened it again and the room was freezing. On a plus side, there is a safe and the power and temperature in the shower were excellent.",Terrible Wi-Fi,2

They asked to run my card in case of incidental charges, phone, etc. I prepaid so I didn't get receipt at checkout. Got home and saw that they charged 11.95. When I called they said that's the policy and that since I didn't use anything the charge would be reversed. Just would have liked to have known that before.",Convenient to UNCC,3

"I always have a free bed in SF, so paying for a hotel bed seems odd, but I was here on business. If you've already committed to spend SF hotel money to stay near attractions, this isn't a bad spend.Pros: location - the Powell St. cable car ends two blocks away from you on the opposite corner of the block of buildings you would be in. Theaters and museums are mere blocks away. Bed - my goodness was this bed comfortable. I don't sleep well on most hotel mattresses, but I did here - which is good because I was here for a week! Wifi - complimentary and pretty good from my room. They have accessible rooms - which oddly enough I got, though I don't need it. Refrigerator in the room! Victory for me. I have medical needs for one, hate shelling out extra, and it is also convenient for keeping fresh fruit and other items cool so I don't have to shell out for the overpriced, less-than-great breakfasts nearby. Individual climate control - it does actually get hot in SF on occasion. The air conditioning did its job.Cons: location - there is a nightclub across the street and these windows don't appear to be double-glazed! They DO have ear plugs in the rooms and I was asked at check in if I needed a street-side or interior room. I was not facing the nightclub, but still got noise when the restaurant downstairs took out the trash at late/early hours. Age. This property IS renovated, but its age shows in spots, like in the wiring that's on the wall instead of behind it and closets that are ridiculously small. Air conditioning is by unit in the window. Some people don't like this (I do). Housekeeping: they didn't seem to want to replace things in the bathroom (i.e. washcloths, not soap) and the toilets are dual flush. Even full flush doesn't... um... always do the job. Ahem. Also, the panhandlers will be waiting for you. Don't head west on some of the nearby streets (esp Eddy). That is the Tenderloin. If you are looking for what the Tenderloin has to offer, well, then go ahead.The list of cons is longer, but I find fault easily - take it for what its worth. There is a popular restaurant attached to the hotel. I did not eat there (spendy), but it attracted a solid crowd in a neighborhood with a lot of competition. There are, of course, a ton of delicious places nearby and it is also around the same corner to the Powell St. Muni/Bart stations. If I came to SF for business again, I would consider staying here eventhough my worksite was not nearby.",3.5 out fo 5 for me. Here's why.,3

"I enjoyed this hotel, I really did. We stayed here twice, once at the beginning of our trip and the second time, was at the end of our trip. There beds were comfortable, but a bit tall, for me anyway. The air-conditioning in our first room was a bit strange and we weren't able to turn it on properly. The bathroom was a good size and they had homemade chocolate chip cookies in the lobby. I later found out that this is done from 3PM Monday - Thursday. A channel that was listed on their channels offered list, came up blocked when I tried to watch it. I just assumed that the subscription hadn't been renewed yet. But, here were the hiccups I mentioned in the title. The second time we stayed here, we came to our room and realised that you couldnt lock the door. It only rested. So if we went out, someone without a key card could enter our room. So obviously, we switched rooms. Luckily, to right next door. When we came back from dinner, I noticed that the toilet had flooded the bathroom. It was because we flushed it. It was as bad as it sounds, it was only a millimetre of water, but we had to change rooms again. So, overall, I really enjoyed this hotel, and even though we had a few inconveniences I still give it a 4 out of 5, I would stay here again and I do recommend it.","It was a nice hotel, even though we had a few hiccups...",4
"For what we paid it was a great value. The night manager on duty was super helpful. Breakfast was fine as there was cold and hot foods available. No complaint about the noise, it was pretty quiet. Pool was quiet the time we were there, which was half the week. The beds were a bit worn, but that was the only complaint i have. Easy accessible location near plenty of restaurants and walmart.

When we arrived we were told we would not be on the same floor as someone who had just fronted at reception was given one of our rooms. I protested and they relented but our rooms were not side by side but quite a distance from each other. This was not good enough. The rooms themselves were nice and the hotel very good. Did have a problem with other guests walking past our door in the early morning and talking rather loudly - enough to wake us up. Also the car park directly underneath the rooms was not good. Motorbikes revving early morning is bad. Good to have computers available to guests. Breakfast was a definite bonus, with alot of variation. Would we stay again - maybe, but would look at other options.",A Little Let Down,3

Put on your walking shoes because this place does NOT have parking close to the hotel. The area of town it is in is also not the most desirable. Guess I should have known that for the price.

When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard.

"Hotel was only worth the 50 that we paid through Priceline. The agent that checked us in was rude and didn't want to be bothered. We were in town for the USC/ Alabama game and flew in early Saturday, due to our schedules. We arrived at the hotel at 9am, requested early check in, the agent didn't even look down and said Check in wasn't till 3p I asked if we were able to get an early check in to the reply we can try for 2p at the earliest she didn't even look down at the computer to see if a room was available. After asking if anything was open now, she was able to find an available room. I have worked in hotels for 10 years, and know that rooms are open if you don't sell out the night before which they didn't. Since our flight was early that morning we decided to rest before heading to the stadium, only to be woken by the housekeeper wanting to inspect the room. Hotel in general is dark and gloomy, halls feel cold and hotel looks like a bad 80s hotel. Watch out for platform bed edges at night, I have a huge bruise due to running into the corner when getting up in the middle of the night. Do yourself a favor and pass up this hotel and spend the money on something nicer.Thank you for your most recent stay. We take great pride providing the highest level of service, guest safety and cleanliness. As you know from working in hotels, we can never guarantee an early check in but will do our best in our attempts to make accommodations for guests wanting to check in early. With that in mind, while we may not have sold every room the night before, reservations are often made for specific room types for a reason and we may have not had your specific room type available at such an early hour as checkout is not until 12 PM. We were indeed sold out for the weekend of the game and our team did their best to get the rooms turned as quickly as possible. Hopefully we will see you again for the next game.",Pass this hotel up for something nicer,2
"Arrived on the heels of Hurricane Matthew! Used the App for check-in and it is like magic!! The lobby was very inviting with plenty of room for those needing to work and those that were watching football. The Red Cross volunteers had a great presence there and were pleased to share stories. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. The ice machine (which worked) was near my room (SCORE)!!! Later that evening, we needed a drink and a snack and we did not have to go far. The Florida State game was on and we joined the folks to cheer the Seminoles on to victory. Fun was had by all in the comfortable seating available. The downtown location is easy to get to and easy access to I-4 the following day. Al in all, nice central location away from Disney. Although a bit pricey, will definitely consider returning when scheduling the next trip.",CONVENIENT DOWNTOWN LOCATION,5
Surrounding area of hotel was a trucker area. A lot of the people who stay here are construction workers. The room was okay but could have been cleaner.

There are many chain restaurants located nearby for convenience. The hotel itself is immaculate and the staff was outstanding, especially Kara, who upon our early arrival was very accommodating and sweet.

"My husband and I stayed at this hotel overnight on our way back from a trip to NC from PA. We arrived after the normal check-in time, but we had to wait a few minutes for our room to be ready. After we settled in for the evening, one of the neighboring rooms occupants were having an argument. They proceeded to slam their door and yell in the hallway on and off for 30 minutes. They were loud enough to wake my husband over the television. When we left our room the next morning, the hallway reeked of marijuana and cheap air freshener. We were getting an early start on our traveling and even though the hotel offered a continental breakfast, nothing was available (not even coffee) before 7:00 am.",A little disappointed,3

"I traveled to Ritz Central Park for my 50th Birthday celebrations with my Mother and my Daughter.... we had this planned for approximately 9 months....Upon arrival we were very impressed with the hotel lobby. Whilst checking in I didnt feel the usual Ritz welcome service I had experienced in other Ritz Hotels. We made our way up to a very pleasant room with a Cava chilling and selection of chocolates and a birthday card welcome which was a lovely touch to the start of our vacation. Our room was not quite ready as the put up bed had not been set up, our arrival was approximately 8pm so I would have thought this would have been done. We hit the shops ( Black Friday). On returning to the hotel all was done. We continued to enjoy our stay at the Ritz which an amazing setting in an ideal location. The doormen where very attentive as we were in and out and nothing was to much trouble for them.Getting ready to go out on Sunday evening I realised an item of jewellery was missing. Security initially could not do enough and we were given access to Club Lounge as we needed to hang around the hotel more than we wanted to to help with investing the incident. Not ideal when we only had a 5 day stay. However, after 24 hours and the item was never found I felt like we were under suspicion. We never heard anything from Security again. Police took statements. On arrival back to the UK we have had to contact Ritz to find out any outcome of their investigation and are still no further on. Overall staying at Ritz Hotels is amazing experience but this particular stay did not make me feel like a valued customer....",My 50th Birthday,3
"It was a quick overnight stay for our family - and unfortunately we left an item behind. I was able to call right away to make sure they had it, and they agreed to ship it to us.

Good experience overall. The hotel room was a little old. There was no plunger next to the toilet so we had to call the staff to come take a look at one point. But nothing much to complain about.,It was just fine,4
"The hallways were dingy and smelled. The room was dirty. The windows were dirty. There were cobwebs near the heater/ac. The towel rack was missing a screw and one corner was completely detached from the wall. Some of the lights did not work. The toilet clogged because of paper. The manager that night said there was not staff available to help and gave us a plunger so we could take care of it ourselves. There were mosquitoes and and other insects all over the hallways and near the ice machine. We were glad we were staying only for one night.

Stay was fine only problem was they charged my credit card for the room as well as the fact as I had already paid ahead of time and it took 2 days for them to remove it after they made the mistake. The manager said a mistake was made but that she had to wait for the charge to drop she could not fix immediately.

Check in was bad. Staff was rude like they wasn't expecting a guest late when I called and confirmed earlier that day. Empty water bottle found in room under a chair while just placing my bag down. I found the same kinda water in the fridge. It was an 8 pack with only one full one left in it. I have no idea if it was supplied by the hotel or not. We threw it out. The toilet made a high pitched noise that would only stop it after you flushed it again. The Kleenex tissue had only 1 tissue and was never replaced at all. The morning we left when we stopped by the continental breakfast the same employee that checked me in was there. She acknowledged 1/10 people in the room. I even said good morning to no reply. It was a convenient location for our trip to Becker College for our son. We had a 2 day orientation and would have had a more pleasant stay here if things like this were actually addressed. I know it's hard work and not appreciated by many. But as for someone that works in customer service every day myself I was amazed by the lack of interaction between hotel staff and guests. These things reflect upon upper management. Maybe some team building exercises to make their job not just a job but a fun and good safe place to work as well. If I was to stay here again it would be simply because of location...:),Could've been better!,4
A very old hotel with old smelling bath tower and bedding fixtures refrigerator is only available upon request but came with broken temperature setting control knob and old floor carpet was not very cleanly vacuumed.

The bed was also comfortable. We had a small balcony that looked over the parking lot and into the city. Every employee we spoke with was polite and super helpful.

We stayed two nights here on our way to Hawaii and we will likely stay here again. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Breakfast has lots of variety and good parking for your vehicle. We were able to leave our vehicle at this location. Price is good for what you get. Just ask for a room that is not close to the front as the traffic is fairly heavy and you can hear it. The shuttle doesn't run after 5:00 so that is unfortunate as you have a twelve dollar taxi fare to get back to the hotel form the airport.,Great Location and Friendly Staff,4
"Having stayed at other locations operated by this chain, I knew not to expect 4 or 5 star lodging, but I did expect more than what we experienced. The hotel ( more like a motor inn), for its part, seems to be trying to improve, but, it still needs a lot of work. The easiest way for me to do this is to list all of the issues we had, so, here goes: 1. Non-smoking room next to a smoking room a room that still reeks of stale cigarette smoke. 2. There was daylight coming through gaps at the top and bottom of the door frame, thus allowing the cool air to escape and the heat and humidity in. 3. Climate control! The ac was set at 76 degrees and we couldn't override the temp to try to make the room more comfortable. 4. Loud and unruly guests and there children hanging in the parking lot very late making tons of noise. 5. Being awakened at 5:30 am on a Saturday to the screams of a woman fighting with her boyfriend right outside our door! 6. After finally getting back to sleep after the incident mentioned in 5, being re-awakened at 9 am on the same Saturday by the sounds of the building being power washed.

"Drury New Orleans was great and I even changed my reservation 3 different times. The last time they booked us for a suite the first night (because of lack of availability) and booked us the regular room the other nights. However, when we arrived, they let us have the suite for all 3 nights and did not charge additional (I might add that it was during the week). This way we didn't have to change rooms. Valet parking, although expensive, was great w/not too long of a wait. Free breakfast (multiple waffle makers, sausage, eggs, pastries, gravy, fruit etc.--not super high quality but better than a lot of hotels), snack type dinner (hotdogs, chicken strips, meatballs, etc..--again, not super high quality but plenty of food excellent offerings especially if you are on a budget), and free popcorn pops from 3-10pm. You could actually eat breakfast at the hotel, dinner at the hotel and then only pay for lunch if you wanted to. My absolutely only complaint about this hotel was that they offered 3 alcoholic drinks for each adult in the evening 5-7 during dinner (only 3 different drinks offered). We are not big drinkers but like to have one from time to time. We ordered one 2 different nights but were unable to drink them because they were so incredibly strong--we even asked to go light on the alcohol to no avail. We were also disappointed they didn't have a full bar where you could pay for a frozen drink if you wanted. Other than that small detail this hotel was really clean, nice clean pool w/plenty of clean towels, friendly staff, quiet and close enough to walk to shops and such. It seemed to be located between the Garden District the French Quarter. We definitely would return.",Great Hotel just close enough to everything!,5

I did read the reviews but generally take reviews with a grain of salt do to disgruntled people leaving the majority of them. however I became part of the disgruntled group. there was no cleaning service while we were in the hotel room. We had to ask for new linens and new towels and only received new towels. The Linens had a distinct bleach stain on them that we could identify that they had never been changed. The linens are not fitted sheets they were just tucked in top sheets so by the end of the night we were looking at the disgusting mattress. it's a shame cuz if this hotel was managed properly it would be a gem. located in a prime spot on st-charles right next to a trolley stop and in a very cute historic building. unfortunately the cleanliness or lack thereof was a major turnoff. I specifically chose this hotel because it looked like a mom and pop but quickly learned my lesson. I will be visiting and specifically staying in a corporate Hotel upon our next trip to New Orleans because I know a corporate Hotel will have quality standards. I was overall very disappointed.,"dirty, roaches and no clean linens.",2
I stayed there with our team. Beds were average. Shower was good. Housekeeping staff seemed OK. We stayed with our team. All of the staff didn't know that we are staying there and we need separate room too eat etc. So we ended up in lobby eating dinner etc. Breakfast was decent and the room was always setup.

The first room we were placed I. Had stains on the sheets and didn't appear to have been cleaned. We also saw a baby roach be changed rooms but still felt uncomfortable.,Roaches and stained sheet,1
Our suite included a full kitchen with every appliance. There's a grocery store at the top of the hill so parents bringing kids can take advantage of the kitchen to avoid eating out every day.,Great location for retreat but access to town takes a while,4
"Didn't have charging stations in rooms. Desk chair was peeling all over the floor and the balcony was covered in pigeon droppings. Good location, enjoyed the breakfast, and the staff is awesome!",Would stay again,5
"The front desk staff needs an introduction to providing better customer service they do what they think their job is, but without any real consideration for the guest in front of them. The room smelled strongly of cleaner enough to make my eyes water. The two control knobs on the A/C unit were broken and amateur repaired so that they did not work. The soap in the bath, down to a sliver, was not replaced. The coffee supplies were not replenished and the waste basket not emptied. They allow people to wander around the facility slipping flyers for other restaurants under the doors not a warm feeling for security awareness. The Cafe served an excellent breakfast good food and excellent friendly staff. I'd suggest you do not pay the up-charge to get breakfast 'included' in the room cost. You can get a good breakfast at the Cafe for much less than the higher room rate, and, if you want to go somewhere else, there are dozens of other restaurants in walking distance. Next time, I'll try a different hotel chain and walk over to the BW Cafe for breakfast.",Maybe not the BEST Best Western,3
"Could not access wi-fi. Ice machines shut down and was advised to go to Hampton Inn and get some. Showers still have a straight shower rod. Really, it's 2015, get a curved shower bar. No one wants to take a shower with the shower curtain touching them!!",Will not stay here again,2

Older hotel hallways and rooms. Clean with comfy bed. Nice lobby and breakfast area nice enough. Needs updating like doors on rooms and bath fixtures.

Beautiful art-deco building on the river with big rooms and a marvelous view at the rivers and skyscrapers -should ask at arrival room with view.,good hotel in excellent location,4
"The only saving grace for this inn was the front desk staff who are highly knowledgeable about San Antonio, the places to see and what to avoid. Having said that all the rest was downhill from the cleanliness especially in the kitchen.I can only imagine this was once a pretty recommendable establishment that maybe got overwhelmed with the amount of units to upkeep daily and with kitchenettes in the units comes the constant need to repair the appliances. In our case none of the kitchen appliances worked (fridge, stove, etc.)The location is reliant on a car if you want to see the sites in the city but there are plenty places to eat in the area if you don't mind walking.",You get what you pay for,2

"The hotel was great it was so close to the boardwalk we saved money on parking. We just left out car at the hotel and enjoyed the beach, bowling alley and the boardwalk. The hotel staff were very friendly gave us so much info on the area since our daughter will be going to UCSC in the fall",Loved it,4
"We stayed here with a large group for our wedding at City Winery and it was nothing but pleasant from the start. Working with the team to set up the room block was made so easy by the incredible staff. Upon our stay, everyone at the hotel went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed and were welcoming and friendly. The hotel has recently renovated the rooms and the lobby/check in area is much more inviting than it was before. Being in NYC, hotel rooms are usually pretty small but I thought these rooms were a good size. I moved into the suite for two nights and that had great views and was big enough for my bridal party and I to get ready in. We hosted brunch on Sunday in the private room at San Marino restaurant next door and it was the perfect send off for our guests. We heard that dinner at San Marino was excellent too, which is also where the room service at Four Points comes from. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!",Great Weekend Stay for Large Group,5

"This must be a well known dog hotel. Unfortunately, I was one of the few who didn't know that in advance. There were many, many yappy dogs early in the morning and late at night. Great if you have a dog, but not so great if you weren't planning on a bark fest.Also, the room service continental breakfast was pretty sad ... cold coffee and old pastries. We should have wandered to the amazing Farmer's Market which runs every Saturday morning across the street at City Hall.And finally, there was no hot water for a few hours in the morning.I've stayed at the Morrison House (a sister property a few blocks away) and found it a notch above in all respects. It was booked on this night or I would have stayed there.",Gone to the dogs,3
"We recently spent three nights at The NOPSI in New Orleans. Nothing but good things to say. Beautiful first impression - absolutely gorgeous lobby! Extremely friendly and helpful staff - from the doormen, the front desk folks, the concierge - everyone! The location was an easy walk to the French Quarter but far enough away from the not so nice part. And the rooms were great - spotless, comfortable and large. Nice bars in the lobby and on the roof and also in the adjacent restaurant (which had a very good breakfast). All in all, A+!Frank, Thank you for visiting NOPSI Hotel.

"Ok.. before I start the review - Can I just say that I always stay at budget hotels and never really have any issues.The continental plaza is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We arrived on the 23rd of December and Natalia was on the front desk, probably the best member of staff that they have, and we had to change room 3 times due to the disgusting smell. We settled on room 408 (top floor and has a view of wet n wild and Universal-one of the only good things about the place.) One way i've been describing this place to friends is for them to think of 'my name is earl'. Basically you enter the room on a balcony and the outside wall is 1 big window.. so you can't leave the curtain open at all if you're in the room! There isn't a window to open either .. so the only way to get air into the room is with the air con which is loud! The rooms smell of damp and the closets have mould patches on them. The cleaners didn't clean the rooms on a daily basis even though the latest we left was around 11am (we even left some crumbs on the floor to see if they hoovered, but they were still on the floor for about 3 days). The sheets smelt weird and im pretty sure the top cover has never been washed! The hairdryer didn't work... there was no Iron in the room although there was an ironing board! The Safe didn't work at first! There were weird brown stains on the bath. The Fridge was so cold that everything we put in there was frozen solid by the next day. Some of the good things- 15 min walk to Universal Studios, Wet n Wild over the road and and iride stop outside the hotel. BUT there are so many hotels close by and you'd get these benefits and a nicer hotel! If this hasn't put you off then you'll have to learn the hard way! We had to and stayed there over Christmas! we even booked a night at a different hotel for 1 evening! Don't do it!",Not a fussy traveller... but would NEVER return here,1
Awesome rooms and staff,Great stay for a game.,3
"If you are not looking for a resort hotel, but looking for a hotel in a great central location, with nice, clean rooms and efficient service, look no further than the Shoreline. We had seven nights here in May 2014 and really enjoyed staying there. It is a cute little hotel, modernized and very comfortable. The bed and pillows were great and I am very fussy! We had a view of the disgusting building next door, and a tiny peep of the sea! Honestly, given the quality of the hotel, the cost, and the little time we spent in our room, it was not a big deal. Why would you pay for a resort hotel and view when it appears you can use the facilities of the pools on the beach anyway during the day. If we ever return to Waikiki, we will be staying at the Shoreline again.Aloha Megan FThank you for your 4 star review. We are thrilled knowing we exceeded your expectations and were able to provide a memorable stay. While it is true we are not a bigger resort our hotel more than makes up for it with our centralized location, complimentary amenities, and competitive room rates. Not to mention our hotel does not charge any resort fees that bigger hotels charge. While it is unfortunate that the view from your room was not to your liking our city view accommodations face the surrounding areas of where this building is placed. For your next trip please consider booking one of our partial ocean view rooms. Thank you once again for your kind words we hope to be able to accommodate you once again.Mahalo,Daniel Floren,Front Office Manager",LOOK NO FURTHER,4

"We found the Hotel to be an old antiquated Howard Johnson. It backs up to highway 87 and the trucks can be heard through the night in the rooms facing the highway which we were in.

"So if you need to find a place for football weekends in Fayetteville, this hotel is only a short hop away, maybe adding an extra 10 minutes to your commute to the campus. We found it to be clean and comfortable. They serve a hot meal for breakfast (eggs, sausage, waffles). Plus you have a kitchen, so you can bring in whatever you want. Avoid being assigned room 110. It looks out into a narrow inlet of the courtyard, so you are looking at a wall and there is a HVAC unit or something right there that is a little noisy.",Nice play to stay for Game Weekends.,4

My roommate needed a lint roller and she called guest services and while they didn't have a lint roller, they tried their best to solve her problem and brought her a roll of scotch tape. We had some drinks and appetizers at the hotel restaurant (jackson 20? jackson #), and the drinks were fun and delicious, as was the cheese and meat plate (I can't spell the fancy word for meat plate--charcuterie?). While it didn't wake me up or keep me up, once I was awake, I did notice that the sound from the hallway was very easy to hear through the door as we were right across from the elevator, but it was not an inconvenience to me, and the rest of our stay was very quiet and private.",Great stay,5

"Visited NOLA with a group of girl scouts and their parents. This hotel was a great base for our large group of 20+. The free breakfast, popcorn and drinks, and kick back made our trip even more economical. Free shuttle to the Mardi Gras museum from the hotel. Great outdoor pool the girls loved to splash around in after a long day of sight seeing. The elevators require roomkeys to access, which is an added security feature we appreciated. Excellent location from which to explore the French Quarter, catch a tram, and head out and about. Also, walking distance from the Amtrak station.",A great economy hotel with mid-range facilities,5

"It was close to the Macon Bi-pass. Was helpful in making a reservation for a early check in (as we were on our way to Florida and got there about 7:00/7:30 AM and they made it happen). The room was nice with a couch, a desk and a king size bed which was comfortable. I did use the swimming pool to do some water walking to stretch out my legs and it was clean and refreshing. The lady at check in was helpful in seeing that we did not have to wait too long to get into a room, she ask if we would go into a room that was not handicap disabled I said yes it on the 1st floor as my husband has feet problems and could not do the steps, she got us a room with a king size bed on the 1st floor. I would definitely go back next time we are going to Florida.",NICE PLACE TO TAKE A BREAK,2

"I was a bit skeptical after reading the reviews but I found the Monarch to be very comfortable. The rooms were clean and the linens were fresh. Our room was always cleaned by the maid service prior to 11am. The staff also was very helpful in getting cabs, shuttles, and directions. Also I wanted to let people know that this is a big city neighborhood. There are homeless people in the neighborhood asking for change, but you find the same people at the wharf and union square. So if you have a budget or even if you dont I recommend the Monarch. You can walk to Union Square in 10 minutes, spend 7 bucks on a cab to the wharf, or walk around the corner to Van Ness and shop for a new Land Rover or Mercedes.",Good Times,3
"We visited Alexandria, VA over the 4th of July weekend. We had a great time, the town was very nice. The shops and restaurants we visited were very good. We enjoyed the marina and enjoyed the fireworks from there. We also enjoyed visiting the George Washington Masonic Temple - great for all you Dan Brown enthusiasts!

"This hotel has a beautiful lobby, professional staff 5 star feel. However, the rooms are small with larger than needed furniture and bathrooms that are average. There are beautiful touches throughout the hotel, great sushi restaurant (from what we heard), but rooms their carpeting feel worn are in need of some space saving touches (like a built-in desk shelving) in order to feel really upscale. Add to that that it sits in the tenderloin district (filled with the cities homeless and drug dealers) it is definitely not a family friendly place to stay one many of you may not want to chose. We had a car, however traveled out of the city quite a bit. Otherwise, I would not plan to stay here and walk in the area, especially at night. Overall, it is a nice hotel. Room service food was way better than average the staff we encountered was the same, but you really don't see them unless you stop at the front desk or walk to the front doors. The extra fee's for everything: 16 wifi, 50+ for overnight parking, 20 gym fee 6 for in room water, made us feel like we were being milked and our agreed upon nightly rate turning into a never again experience. One positive note I'd like to add is that Starbucks is adjacent to the hotel, all you need do is open a hotel door you're there:)Hello MarrieinLove (I love your name!)-Thank you for taking the time to write a review.

"We chose Residence Inn by Marriott Irvine basically for its convenient location near the airport. Because of the convenient and complimentary hotel shuttle, it allowed us to make our visit to Orange County without having to rent a car. A local cab took us to our primary social event of that week-end. In addition to the convenience of the location, we were totally pleased to find our accommodations so exceptional as well as being able to enjoy the host of amenities that were offered by the hotel. And lastly, I cannot overlook the staff. They were exceptional people - and those include the breakfast area hosts who keep the area always stocked and continually tidy throughout the various time frames of breakfast.

I must begin by thanking the guest services staff who worked pleasantly to return a jacket I accidentally left in my room closet! Michael and Bridget were beyond gracious when I phoned to ask if the items could be found and then shipped to my home. Their attitudes and attention were lovely! Our Thanksgiving weekend was very pleasant due to the fun atmosphere and beautiful Gatsby-ish decor along with the great staff. We enjoyed prosecco and hot toddies in the evenings and wonderful continental breakfast at the hotel restaurant. Our room on the 12th floor was quiet and the elevator service was great. We simply cannot praise this hotel enough! There were many nice conversation areas sprinkled around the lobby which were inviting and provided nice areas to enjoy the holiday decorations! Be sure to join the Kimpton Rewards program for free WiFi and credit for the minibar! Dont hesitate to book this great downtown/theatre district hotel!Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback.

Leaks all over the bathroom, there was a puddle from the moment we walked in. To top it all off, they refused to do a refund despite us staying in the room for only 2 hours, and didn't try moving to another room (like I would trust the hotel anymore.) They said the cutoff time for a full refund was 20 minutes. Or at least that's what they told me three days later. It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.) Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess. I'll be disputing this with my bank.

"My wife and I were just staying at the hotel for one night and believe me when I say I didn't expect much to begin with because you get what you pay for, which is fine.I just needed an economical stay for one night - that's all.Well this one night stay turned out to be a nightmare!1) We arrived very late because our flight got delayed into San Fran. When we finally got to the hotel it was after midnight and there was one attendant working the front desk.As he was checking us in, the hotel system went down. The man spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out what to do and could not check us in at all. When he finally had everything back up, it all went down again which led to a much longer wait just to get our room. We finally got our room key well past 1am, which was after more than an hour of waiting.2) This next issue makes the first one seem like nothing.Our room was on the 3rd floor and the next morning I wanted to go move my car closer to our room. I called up the one and only elevator they have in the place and took it down to the main floor. Well just before I got to the first floor the elevator just stopped. I realized It was stuck. It is a very small and old elevator which made me feel so claustrophobic! I pressed all the buttons trying to go back up, open the door, the alarm button and what not. I even knocked on the door and screamed for help.I was in the elevator for about 10 minutes but it seemed like an hour and no one came to my assistance. Finally I kept holding the door open button and the door opened a crack and I pushed it open the rest of the way. It was on the ground floor thankfully so I was able to walk out. I had a did that just happen moment and was in total shock.What was even more shocking was that there was a sign on the first floor noting the the elevator was out of service! That's great but where was the frickin sign on the second and third floors Who was the genius that decided one sign would be enoughI got to the front desk and spoke with the man on duty and explained the situation. All he said was that he's new and he will put signs on the other floors (better late than never) and that the manager wasn't in that day so they would reach out to me.I took the manager's email address just in case. We checked in and got the hell out of there.Well it's been a week now and I haven't heard anything from management at all. In fact I emailed them a few days ago explaining why I had such a horrible situation to give them a chance to address it and I've gotten nothing back.I realize the elevator situation and the system going down might just be bad luck but it's how the staff responded that makes me upset. Absolutely no customer service whatsoever.If you decide to stay here don't expect service you'd get from an average hotel. It's far worse.",Not Safe and Horrible Service,1

Since this is mandatory, it should be included in the overall rate. The room was fine but there was a funny, fishy smell in the hallway on my floor.

"This hotel is perfectly situated for harbor excursions from piers along 12th avenue. Easy walking distance to Piers 73 and 78. The hotel itself is geared towards efficiency. The rooms are small, but clean, modern and comfortable. You are provided with a nice desk console and wardrobe, plenty of charging outlets and an ergonomic chair. I am not sure if any rooms have a direct water view, but my view along 38th () was interesting, and a sliver of the river could be seen. There is also an outdoor terrace of sorts, in the front of the hotel, which I didn't use,but looked like a pleasant place to sit and people watch.'My only complaint is breakfast, which ends at 9:30. I went down at 9 and it was a mob scene. And there were no seats. I ended up at a computer table. I suggest breakfast go until ten, or that they add more seating. At any rate, go earlier for breakfast. Breakfast is the usual Holiday Inn affair. Not gourmet, but adequate.",Location,4

"I stayed here for one night in a single queen room. The room was very small and dated. The worst part of this property is how thin the walls are. You can hear every conversation that your neighbors are having as well as anytime the toilet is flushed, shower is on, door is open/closed etc. If you are only looking for a cheap place to stay this may suit your needs but there are many better options in hotel circle (even for the same price).",Low budget option,3

One elevator for this large 10 story hotel was not good. Also all the hallways and elevator were extremely muggy and hot. When we arrived we had to park in the far extra parking lot and carry all of our luggage I. The pouring rain bc they allowed bikers to park under the entire awning unload rock. Very dissapointed in that lack of customer service. Other than that we had a beautiful room with very comfortable beds and a great view.,Mostly satisfied....,4
"This hotel accomplished what we wanted. At the entrance to Canyon de Chelly. Registration was a breeze. Cleanliness was great. The grounds and condition of our building, were premium. The area had a recent storm and part of the cable was out. No local stations. That is only negative. Ate breakfast at Garcia's Restaurant. Blue corn pancakes were fabulous. Our service was superior.

"We stayed here for one night with our 2 young kids. As mentioned in other reviews, some of the suites are quite small, although some of that is probably just due to having a divider in the middle of the two parts. It was nice having a divider between us and the kids, even if it was just a clear door. The one suggestion I would make to improve the property would be to have either clouded glass or curtains over the glass part of the doors so that they're not completely transparent. That way you can still watch TV after the kids have gone to bed without worrying about waking them up.While the rooms show some use, the property has been kept up well. The pool was clean and heated and there are some nice areas for eating outside in the perfect San Diego weather. The hotel is about 10 minutes from Sea World, Mission Bay, and downtown,so its a quick jump to everywhere, although the downside is that nowhere is within walking distance. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They were very accommodating when we requested a crib for the room and, after we left one of our phone chargers, they went to our room and called us when they had found it. Service like that is what makes this hotel go from just average to very good.Overall, this hotel is a solid choice, as long as you don't mind driving to the local attractions. Also, just as a tip, there's a parking fee for parking in the lot, however, you can park on the steet for free, as long as you can find a spot.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests.

"The first night I was there, hotel staff slid a note under the door at 9:30 that evening letting us know that they would be coming into the room the next morning at 9:00 am to do some sort of construction, and they would come in even if we had the Do Not Disturb sign up. Nothing was said to us when we checked in earlier that day at 3:00 pm, which would have been a nice warning. The way they let us know was extremely unprofessional and rude.",Nice hotel and best value I've found when needing to travel to OC,3
"The check-in starts at 3pm, we got there after 7pm and there was nobody in the reception. About ten minutes later a lady showed up, checked us in and only then told us that the housekeeper had forgotten to clean our room, and she was the one doing it! And she needed half an hour to finish up!! Maybe that happened because it was Thanksgiving weekend...We were coming from a long drive that followed a long flight, but since we were also hungry we did not complain. Getting to the room there were no sheets on the beds (only on the mattresses) and no blankets. Since we started off on the wrong foot, it was hard not to notice the small details:The outlets were loose and you could not move the charger cord while charging somethig because it would fall off.We were sharing the room in four people and it got a little small with all the luggage we had.The bathroom was not the cleanest, and the way to control the temperature of the water is awful.The TV was big and looked pretty good but did not work. It was almost impossible not to accidentally hit it. I did not like the setup of the room, the position of the table and the mirror.The only pros are the free parking (unusual for the area) and the treats in the morning, like good donuts and croissants at the reception.",Good for low expectations,3

"We stayed here before a Saints game with kids. Pros: Location was perfect for this - room was clean and large and the kids loved the games in the bar. The bar staff was particularly helpful and friendly. Cons: the front desk is understaffed and really slow, both check-in and check-out. The breakfast area ran out of almost all items and closed early. The hotel screwed up our pre-arranged late checkout and locked us out, and then gave us the wrong key TWICE. Long story, but the whole mix up ended up costing us 45+ minutes.Well that's certainly not the experience we hope to provide.

"Terribly managed hotel. Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while. Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in. One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available. The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same.",Worst hotel I have stayed,2

"Stayed in this hotel for one night while visiting new orleans to scope out a wedding venue. The pros: This hotel is in an awesome location!! We walked to everywhere and didn't have to drive anywhere. The hotel staff was friendly. Free breakfast of orange juice and a croissant delivered to your room. The room was clean, nice, and had everything we needed. The cons: the door had a big space between the frame and the door that you could see between. Found a roach in the bathroom the morning we were leaving. The biggest problem would be the shower! The way you switch it from where the water comes out the faucet for a bath to coming out the shower head for a shower is by pulling up on a lever, well the lever would NOT stay up. When my fiance tried to shower before we left, he had to hold the lever up while rinsing his hair out and washing his face which is highly annoying. Other than that everything else was fine. Dear Courtney W,Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We are pleased that you liked our location, friendly staff, breakfast and clean room. However, let me apologize for missing the mark in regards to the shower. The lever that controls the water flow is a part of our preventative maintenance program and should have been changed prior to your stay. We appreciate your feedback so that we may make improvements on our end. We hope that you were able to find a beautiful wedding venue!

"This was our first time in Baltimore, and the neighborhoods are hit or miss there. This was a pretty good part of town- not much there yet. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel had a smell to it though- there were smoking rooms I think- but the hallway was very musty. Everything looked clean though. The location must have been a newly developed area, there was not much right by the hotel- but it was convenient to hop on the interstate.

"This was our 8th hotel in 9 days. It was by far the nicest hotel we stayed at for half the cost of the others. Each of the rooms have animal names, which makes it nice for families with young kids. The breakfast was standard breakfast fair - eggs, sausage, biscuits, gravy, potatoes, cereal, etc. It was decent, but nothing spectacular. The beds are double size, so a little small, but the room was a good size, so you weren't tripping over each other. Our only complaint was the air conditioners did not seem able to keep the room cool - in either room we were in. We had it set at 70, then moved it down to 66, but still sweat throughout the night. It was a muggy feeling. But other than that, this hotel was great.",Nice Hotel - Good Location,4

"We recently spent a night at Homewood Suites while we visited the MOA. The location was great, right across the street from the Mall. The downside is that you are also close to the airport and we could hear the planes from our room, but that really didn't bother us too much. The room was nice and what we expected. Kitchenette was a nice touch to have while having a 16 month old. The separate bedroom was also nice. We did have breakfast that the hotel offered. Waffles, cereal, fruit, toast/bagels, juice, and some other hot items were offered. This was okay. There were cheese omelettes and you could tell they used egg beaters, so I didn't care for those, but otherwise it was fine for breakfast included with your rate. The one negative thing I will say is that Saturday when we checked out, I went down to the front desk around 10am-a very busy time, and the front desk only had one person working. This was terrible. The line was long and people were not happy. For being a weekend, there should have been 2 people working here. One other thing to touch on that didn't bother me so much, but it might some others. When I asked for a receipt, they only email you a receipt, nothing printed. Those who don't use the internet would not like this.

The bedrooms and the living room had a partition. Chairs table and a work station were in the living room. Our room overlooked the jacuzzi.The faucet in the bathroom definitely need work. It was tricky to figure out warm and cold since they worked in oopposite directions. Once we got it it was easy. I found the bathroom tiles like those found in a garden. had to use my slippers as they really hurt once out from the bath tub. We asked for the sheets not be changed. Liked their way of saving the environment. Requested for the towels to be changed.I wish the management had extra soaps since there were 5 people staying in the suite. We didnt have the time to go and request this.. We always carry some incase of instances where there aren't any. Breakfast was rrealy really good.. sausages, 2 types of eggs, cold and hot breakfast. There were tables and chairs inside as well as outside. Lots of place to sit. When depparting i needed some hot water. Couldnt find any in the coffee area, so the front desk requested the breakfast room door to be opened to assist my request. Thought this was really nice.

Bruce drove to me to my, around the corner, destination, without batting an eye, even in this crazy weather. Faith has been here the whole time, making sure rooms are ready, and that customers and her staff are happy and in good spirits, under the circumstances. I had to switch rooms and was a little ahead of the move, when I notified Sidah, who was making sure my new room was clean and in order. She offered to help me gather my belongings, and move them to my new room. I know, from experience, that most employees, at hotels, don't even offer to hold the door in that situation and here she was offering to help relocate me. I had an issue with my T.V.

"Jelly beans. Pineapple water. Sculpture. Wood . Crystal. Old fashion feel .Not your typical luxury ritz. Friendly staff, professional and accomadating. Lovely ballrooms , nice lobby bar.

"Restaurant had a menu with a waiting time for your entree was 20min, we got our food 1 hour and a half later and the worst quality, couldn't eat it. Paid extra for the executive floor, although service was ok, the food variety and quality was unacceptable.",Very Nice Hotel,3
My room was clean and nicely laid out. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast which had a good selection. I did not get a chance to checkout the social hour in the evening.,Great stay.,5
"Very old facility. Very noisy because of the horrible layout. Complementary breakfast was poor and served in a room that can fit no more than 10 people.. Room was ugly (bed, bath, ...). The only thing I save is the location... but the place is so small that it's not really difficult to be near the shops, restaurants and Morro rock... you can likely find a better deal for the same (low) quality.",consider something else,2
"Bad: I didn't appreciate the attitude of a few of the female employees in regards to the nightclub. I also would prefer a little more variety in the DJ's music choice. It seemed like ALL techno versions and sometimes we just want to hear the ACTUAL songs mixed. Other than that, I loved the property. Good: I loved the decor. Everything about the hotel from the lobby to the room was fantastic. The wood floors, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the shower overlooking the bedroom... PHENOMENAL! I loved the modern, but still comfortable feel. All employees I came in contact with had fantastic customer service skills with the exception of a few in the nightclub. Overall, this property is definitely on my list of Chicago properties as we visit often. Next time we will try out the spa as we didn't get a chance this visit.",I loved the decor.,4
"My stay here was very nice, the staff were nice, the hotel was in great condition and had great views to downtown. Very reasonable pricing also. My only complaint is that we did not know ahead of time that all rooms do not have a refrigerator. I was informed that only the executive king suites have refrigerators. Lucky enough for us we brought along an icebox and was able to keep everything cold. All in all I would recommend this hotel!",Good Visit,4
"Our room was small but the usage of space was amazing. I was so impressed with the cleanliness, decor and comfort of the room. The location of the hotel was great. We were able to walk to multiple districts (Union Square, SoMa, ChinaTown, North Beach). The hotel staff was very friendly and polite. Great places to eat/drink within a couple of blocks of the hotel. Business center was very nice.","Great location, great amenities",5
Try the spa!,Nice rooms but way too noisy,1
"I looked forward to staying at this hotel for so long and I was so disappointed. My room never got cleaned, the young lady at the front desk on Friday was just plain rude when answering questions about the hotel. There were numerous areas of the hotel that needed attention badly. From a distance it looks beautiful, but up close the hotel was just plain dirty and run-down. I fully realize this Best Western because of it's location does a huge volumn of business, which is all the more reason that things should be kept in much better condition. I would love to visit again because the views are wonderful and the beds are comfortable. However, the water running all night as well as the unkept grounds and bad service may cause me to change my mind. I am afront office manager at another BW location and I simply can't believe the things I saw and heard during my visit to this property.",A VERY DISAPPOINTING TRIP,1
"I come to San Diego several times a year. This time wanted to try 2 different hotels. Stayed June 21, 2016, Room 319. The check in and check out was a breeze. Everyone I came in contact was very professional and helpful. This stay was a partial ocean view, 2 QN room. I highly recommend if you could afford it, stay in a full ocean view. The partial ocean view means you will be assigned a room on either side of the hotel. From the patio you do get a slight view if you turn one of the chairs and put it right in the corner. If sitting on the other chair you will not be able to see the ocean. Again, did I say it is just a slight ocean view. Being on the side of the hotel it was harder to hear the ocean waves. I would bet that the full ocean view rooms you would definitely hear the waves as these rooms face the boardwalk and beyond that the beach. The patio has 2 chairs and a small end table. It is nice to be able to hang up wet clothes. You can leave your patio door open to feel the nice ocean breeze. I would highly recommend the higher floors so that you can leave your patio door open all night and be secure. As others have commented, this facility is no resort but it is not a motel either. It is perfect for a get away to the beach. The room is modern enough, the beds were comfortable, and a really nice big tiled bathroom. The vanity is inside the bathroom. The shower didn't have the best pressure but it was decent. The shower is big and enclosed in glass. The bathroom has huge thick beach towels to use. Yes the decor in the hallways and the carpet is very outdated but not old or shaggy. The carpet in the room was ok. There is a small fridge to put drinks in. All in all, the room is very comfortable. There is a continental breakfast. (Standard waffle making, oatmeal, cereals, muffins, danishes, yogurts, fruit, hard boiled eggs, and drinks.) There is plenty of room to sit at a table. It was great for us, all the food constantly being restocked. The pool and hot tub were heated and great. Nice relaxing area with lots of pool chairs. What I liked as well is that you can go out the back of the hotel straight to the beach access. In fact, it's just across the boardwalk. There is a life guard station right there. After you day on the sand you can wash off at an outside shower at the hotel. This is so perfectly convenient to wash off the sand from your feet, clothes, and beach toys. Having a room/hotel so close is so convenient for potty breaks if you have kids. You don't have to walk a long distance to find a bathroom. It's just right up to your room. The underground parking was nice as this whole area is always crowded and parking hard to find. There is a price for the parking which all San Diego hotels seem to charge. It is underground and didn't have any problems finding space. You are close to the elevator and can lug all your suitcases easily. There is a Ralph's grocery store and lots of restaurants (fast food and fine dining) within walking distance. So everything is close by. You will need a car if going to Balboa Park, Old Town, etc. I love how practical this place was to bring kids and just had a good time. I will be coning again. Just wished it wasn't so expensive.We really appreciate you taking the time to provide us with this all of this feedback. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed the view and overall had a good time with your stay. Thank you for letting us know some areas of opportunity for us to work on, we are always striving to do better and we will take these suggestions very seriously.

"Nice hotel, clean comfortable. Free breakfast was above average. Plenty of nearby restaurants stores to walk to or within hotel shuttle service. I would definitely stay here again. Only 2 complaints: 1-Although we used the shuttle for several days to get to/from the Metro, we were never told that the shuttle service ended at 10 PM. Imagine our surprise when returning one night after a Nationals baseball game! 2-On the day we checked out Housekeeping tapped on the door at 8 AM immediately tried to open the door.

"I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

"This was a business trip for 3 nights chosen for it's very close proximity to where I had to attend a business class. Valet parking was very quick efficient, both coming going. The desk clerks were very friendly, efficient and accommodating. The room was sparkling clean and nicely appointed (I was in the older part but couldn't have asked for a better room). My room faced Poydras, so may have been a little better view than other parts of the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised that the bathroom/vanity area had very nice bright lighting and the water pressure and hot water were excellent. Nice extras - 3 complimentary alcoholic drinks and a nice assortment of foods during the 5:30-7pm evening cocktail/food period.. meatballs, ziti pasta, hot dogs, chips, cheese dip, salad bar, chicken fingers, baked potatoes, etc. in a nice large open area to dine, so even though there were many people taking advantage of this, it wasn't uncomfortably crowded and the food bars were well-attended. Though I did not get the opportunity to see much of the city, it was definitely within walking distance of the riverwalk area and the French Quarter.

"This was a decent place to stay for a short weekend trip to Pittsburgh. I'd book for a 1-2 night stay but I'd look for a nicer hotel if I planned to stay longer. The staff was friendly and helpful they quickly fixed our sink which was found to be leaking when we checked in. The facility is showing a little wear and could be cleaner, but it wasn't filthy like some other Super 8 locations I've frequented. Our room was sufficiently clean. The biggest draw for us was the price and the location for a short stay. The neighborhood is quiet there are no residential neighborhoods right next to the property. There's an Aldi grocery store across the street if you need snacks or other food items. The basic breakfast was nice for a quick bite before leaving there was yogurt, toast, cinnamon rolls, muffins and even waffles. The only complaint that I have has nothing to do with the motel or staff it was the guests. A bunch of high-school or college age punks were staying there too and created lots of noise and disturbances they behaved like the place was their dorm or frat house. Eventually management got them to quiet down but I think that they should have called the local police and had them forcefully ejected from the premises. Cheap lodging invites punks it's a risk you take if you stay in an inexpensive place like this.",Good for a short stay but beware of other guests,4

"Have stayed in this motel every couple of years and it has gone done in the following respects, though the room accommodation remained good: 1)Housekeeping personnel and desk-clerk and manager, always kept someone smoking within five-feet of the entrance/ext. Annoying. 2)In the past the Continental Breakfast was nicely presented. Not this time. Had to ask for one thing and thing another, calling the desk-clerk to leave the lounge chair more than once, rather than his surveying the kitchen to see what else may be lacking. 3)At the top of the stairs cigarette smoke-smells were prevalent, though I had a non-smoking room. Though not overpowering, my room had the scent of the same. I will not stay there again on my next trip in two years.",Continental Breakfast sucked,2

It was around 8:00pm when we got there.The room was spacious and clean which is always appreciated especially at a reasonable price.

There was fruit, yogurt, eggs, cereal, juice, bagels and waffles. The standard spread that one would expect. The food was continually stocked which was nice. My only complaint was the seating was very limited. There was not enough room for the amount of people showing up to breakfast, so we and a couple other groups had to stand for a while until someone offered us a seat.There also is a pool at this hotel which looked nice, but unfortunately, I didnt get to try it out.

Convenient location. Affordable price. Stayed before leaving on vacation by plane. Was allowed to leave my car free of charge while gone. Shuttle service to and from the airport was prompt and courteous. Breakfast was available. Pool and hot tub were clean and enjoyable. Staff was extremely helpful and made sure our stay was great. Rooms were being renovated and updated. Only downside was the elevator was out of order but was being fixed the next day.,Horrible Hospitality,5
To our surprise the hotel is under construction therefore the pool is not working at point. Also the hotel had a water leak therefore we didn't have water. We asked for management to move us to another comfort inn within 8miles radius. It was an inconvenient especially when your children are coming along.,Stress out,2

"I recently spent several nights at this hotel while attending a convention. Let me get the negative out of the way: my room was tiny.I don't know if I would have received a slightly larger room had there been a second adult on my reservation, but my first thought when I entered the room was that I was glad I was alone because there was not enough room for two people's luggage.But once I got settled, I was cozy and happy in that room. I was not bothered by noise from the hallway. Both room and common areas were clean. Hotel staff were gracious and friendly. Water pressure was fine.The convention center ( and the Museum of Modern Art) is a 10-minute walk from the hotel, which is faster than taking a car, and 10-15 minute walk to other hotels that attract conventioneers. Easy to get an Uber if you want to get to other parts on San Francisco. Plenty of places just a few steps away to get an easy breakfast. They have a laid-back happy hour in the early evening which is a nice little perk. Overall, I would just say that I felt very safe and welcome in that hotel. I would definitely consider it for a future visit in the financial/convention district.",Great for convention,4

"I travel through Philadelphia frequently and find a need for a hotel between flights. I found the hotel fits my needs and the price is right. Many reviews state that it needs an update. The halls are indeed in need of a face lift. My room was quiet, clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast was good, but running out of things as I waited till the end to go downstairs and it was bursting at the seams. The front desk treats you as if you are the only guest and they are there for your every need. Another guest was looking for the apple store the desk clerk quickly found where it was and called a taxi company to find out what the fare would be there and back. I consider this to be over and above what a desk clerk usually does, kudos to that employee. I have had trouble before with the shuttle service with other hotels in Philadelphia airport area and found them to be sadly disappointing. You can depend on their shuttle service and as with every other employee of this hotel, the driver was a total delight, plus offered me a bottle of water for the drive. Do not let the need for an update of the common area stop you from staying at this great hotel that truly knows the meaning of customer servHello!Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your feedback. Our team is truly dedicated to providing outstanding service at all times. It is a commitment of ours to ensure that no guest leaves unhappy.

Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party.

All the staff we dealt with were friendly and efficient. Great pet policy.",Simply great stay,5
"Lodge is a quaint yet lovely historical house. The nice, clean, surrounding neighborhood, as well as the lodge's close proximity to the beach and downtown shops and restaurants, make it an ideal place to stay if you enjoy pleasant walks. We stayed in Room 3 which is upstairs. Although we had our own bathroom, it was extremely small. It looked as though a shower had been added to a bathroom that was never intended to hold one. It was manageable, but no real room to set anything. For us, the bed mattress was firm enough, but it caved in the center causing us to roll to the middle - a sure sign that it is in need of replacement. The lodge is pet friendly, so be prepared for possible barking. The room next to ours and the one below us both had dogs in them. While I cannot complain that there was a great deal of barking, there was enough at the wrong time of night to wake us up, and unfortunately, I have a difficult time falling back to sleep. That said, it was our choice to take the chance, just wouldn't do it again. Breakfast at Panera is so-so. Blanca at the lodge was extremely friendly and helpful.",Good and not-so-good,3

"This was our first visit to New Orleans and I wanted to stay in a hotel that represented the architecture the area is known for. I chose St. James based on that as well as some of the reviews I had read. As our trip got closer, I became slightly concerned with some of the reviews I read about cleanliness and other issues. Well, after our stay, I have come to the conclusion that some people just like to complain over stupid stuff. We were greeted by a very friendly doorman and were so impressed with the decor upon entering the hotel. Registration is not a typical high counter, but two desks which put you face to face with very friendly agents. Arielle took care of us and was so friendly, giving us information on the area, highlighting points of interest based on what we wanted to see. We requested a high floor (there are only four) and were placed on the third floor away from the elevator. Our king room was spacious and very clean. We had a corner room (311) which gave us four windows and plenty of natural light. Two of the windows overlooked the courtyard and the other two an alley facing a building. On our bed was the card to fill out for breakfast the next morning. We turned the card into the front desk when we decided to go out and explore a bit before turning in for the night. The next morning our breakfast was delivered to our room at the time we requested with all items we requested, croissants (4), coffee (2) and orange juice (1) on a silver tray with sugar, cream, butter and jams. I have never experienced anything like this and found it to be so nice. This was repeated during our entire stay. Each time we left or came back to the hotel, we were greeted by very friendly people who always asked if we were enjoying our stay or if there was anything they could do to make our stay even more enjoyable. We explored the hotel a bit and loved the decor and architecture in every area. The courtyard was inviting and comfortable. We decided to find the pool and agree with the other reviews that it is not big enough to swim in, but we didn't go there for that and appreciated the atmosphere the area offered. My personal recommendation would be to turn it into an active fountain instead of a pool. Oh, the reviews that mention leaving the room, coming back in the afternoon to an unmade bed and room are simply not true. We left our room every morning by 10:30 and returned in the late afternoon (3:30) to drop stuff off and always found our room to be remade and just as clean as the first time we entered. This hotel is centrally located to everything and off the main areas making sleeping easier away from all the Bourbon Street noise and activity. Mind you, there is noise, but it is city noise which you would get in any city hotel such as fire trucks making runs or ambulance runs. Nothing I haven't experienced in New York or Boston. You have to expect you will hear some city noise when staying in a city! If I ever return, I will most definitely stay at the St. James Hotel.",Wonderful Stay,5

Poorly kept up, halls are dark and freezing, the property is aging and ridiculously neglected by the ownership. While I wasn't interested in a jetted tub, the listing touts it as a feature in their rooms, which is completely untrue. Not only was the tub not jetted, I didn't even want to use the tub or shower at all. I don't go into a standard motel with unfair expectations, but to pay 100 dollars for a dive is incredibly disappointing. Like I said, the staff was the only highlight.

"Awful, awful, awful!!! On our trip from FL to VT we had stayed at a Hampton the previous night and it was just exceptional, so we sought out another Hampton Inn along our trip. We were traveling with our 2 non-shedding very well behaved medium sized dogs and were told at check in that there would be a 75 pet fee per dog! There was no indication of this online at all. The check in clerk stated that they were having problems with dogs so just changed their policy to charge a fee, and she was nice enough to only charge us for one pet - 75.00. Are you kidding We were then put in one of the pet rooms which shared a wall with the elevator and that's exactly what we heard the entire night, the elevator going up and down. We asked to be moved but was told there are only so many pet friendly rooms and there were no other rooms available. Pet friendly You must mean pet tolerant since in no way was this hotel pet friendly.

My family decided to stay here the night after spending the day at Virginia beach before heading home. The hotel seemed ok and clean and all was well until about 1am. A couple arrived in the room next to ours and were fighting. It got so loud I had to call the front desk and while I was doing this the women was screaming that she was being beat. There was a lot of banging around and the manager along with someone else came up right away. They proceeded to call the police but when they got there the man had already left. This was a very traumatic experience for my wife and kids and management did not even try to talk to us about it. This was not an experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel.

"Despite keeping my expectations low I was very disappointed. In my opinions the ratings are not justified and deceiving. This place is not the best. Rooms are dirty. Starting from the carpets to the bedsheets. I don't think they even replace the sheets. The shower curtain in my room smelled awful, towels were not the cleanest and bathroom and living area were dusty. At least the AC was working well otherwise I would have left on arrival. I gave one star for the fridge/microwave in the rooms and the complementary breakfast, which is one of the better ones, You can make fresh waffles, biscuits and gravy, hard boiled eggs, cereal, muffins, coffee, etc... Need to get there early though. Overall, I'm a very dissatisfied customer.",Great Staff at Clean Hotel with Standard Amenities,2
"Overall the stay was good. I made an error during the original booking and needed to extend my stay by one night. I attempted to do this at the front desk and I was told everything was good to go. However, the next morning I found out that the first attempt at extending my stay was completely botched and I had to do it all over again with a new attendant. Other than that one thing, it was a pleasant stay. Nothing special, but nothing I would stay away from either.",Good enough for a short business trip,4

Nearly slipped and fell in the shower because it was so slippery only to find out that the water pressure was so terrible it only trickled - except for the part that was spraying directly on the ceiling. Layout of the bathroom was poor and cramped. Iron burns on the carpet.,Won't be back.,2
The trip was good overall but the complex is so big that taking a cart around was the only way to get anywhere. The carts should come around every 5 minutes but it was more like 20-30 minutes. When you first arrive they have a company that sells you cheaper excursions at a discount if you go to the property time share and what they don't tell you is you will still need to pay more fee's when you get to the excursion. Don't try to get a refund becuase they will pass you around from supervisiors to Managers.,Nice hotel but can't get in the water.,3
"We are a family of 5. We had a king suite with pull-out sofa bed. The room was clean and well maintained and fully stocked with everything we might need in - kitchenette had all dishware, stove, microwave, coffeemaker. The beds were large and comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was nice - eggs, yogurts, pastry, waffles, coffee, etc. The hostess was always there to clean up and replenish the food. The location was somewhat away from the downtown (10 min drive), but conveniently close to a nice hike up the Pilot Butte. We would definitely recommend this place to a friend.",Good stay for a family in Bend,5
"This was my first time ever staying at a Homewood Suites. I'd comparison shopped hotels in the area for a while leading up to our Disney vacation, and for me the modern look of the rooms and the complimentary hot breakfast and dinner made this hotel the best value. The room was spotless each day when we returned from the parks and was always well stocked. We had a nice view of the pool and were very close to the elevators. I love that the rooms have separate living and sleeping areas. The only thing I didn't enjoy was listening to the people above me sliding their dining chairs across the tile floors at all hours, but other than that, the hotel was very quiet. The location was good and seemed to be right in the middle of everything as far as Disney parks, restaurants, stores, and banks. The hotel also has a Disney shuttle, but we didn't use it because we didn't want to be stuck at any of the parks for a whole day. I will say (perhaps depending on your issue) it takes more time than it should to have issues resolved both through the hotel and Hilton. I got the run around for months and had to call customer service several times for something the former manager could've fixed before we left Florida.Greetings, My name is John Carpenter and I am the Assistant General Manager here at the Homewood Suites by Hilton and wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for your feedback.

Its a older hotel but very nice. Showers were great and well stocked kitchen. We paid 69 for one night but arrived at 1:00 am so that may be why we got a good rate.

"I'm used to airport hotels being over crowded and worn down from the sheer crush of people going in and out. This goes double for ones in a tourist mecca like Orlando.But this property is far from that. We stayed for three nights over New Years, and were impressed from start to finish. Common areas were just as clean and polished as the rooms, and though we didn't use them, the pool, fitness room, and business centers all looked spiffy, clean, and well kept. The staff do an amazing job keeping things running well for guests, and it shows!We did use the restaurant after our late night arrival, and we were impressed there too. The cheeseburger was cooked just right, toppings were fresh and crisp, and the fries were outstanding. The wife had the chicken quesadilla and it too was way better than we might have assumed. Good beer and wine list as well, and we even snagged a mini bottle of prosecco to ring in the new year with later.Breakfast buffet was good also. Mostly standard fare, but all was cooked well, served hot and fresh, and coffee pot was never empty. Can't ask for too much more there.Overall, we had a great experience here. We normally don't use airport hotels, but of the ones we have used over time, this one sets a dang high bar. I'd definitely recommend it.",Best Airport Hotel I've Experienced,5

"My wife and I decided to take a vacation to Seattle. Apparently, the entire population of North America had the same idea. The closest I could get to downtown was this SpringHill Suites. I wish we'd just chosen another city or another time.The suite was small, as with all such hotels of this sort, but was clean. As other reviewers have pointed out, there was some noise. The breakfast was excellent. The bed was hard as a rock and the pillows were abominable--even the replacements we asked them to give us. Free internet access was nice. Our main problem--it was a half- to three-quarter mile walk to any really decent restaurant. And the walk led through a questionable neighborhood. I was negatively impressed by the location, and would not stay here again.Oh, yes. We had a car (parked at 20 per night), but parking in downtown Seattle is a proble,, and quite expensive.",Far Out,2
Staff was very friendly. Condo was clean and very well maintained. Kitchen was stocked with all the essentials. Close to everything you need. Even got to see dolphins from the balcony one morning.

"The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the strong odor of cigarette smoke. All of the signs indicated it was a non smoking room as requested but clearly someone had been smoking for quite some time in there. The hotel should have taken steps to remedy this before putting us in the room. I went to the desk seveal times to complain but no one was ever there. I was also puzzled at the lack of lotion and pen in the room. Seems minor but even in much more budget hotels, these things are always provided.

"I genuinely had no complaints while staying here, other than the young kids in the pool/spa area. The parents didn't really watch, and no staff were supervising the area to give reminders about horseplay, diving, etc, so adults were splashed and crowded at times. Everything! Breakfast was great, the beds were comfortable, and our room overlooked the beach (literally steps away). The staff were amazingly attentive (my aunt slid in the bar area and was immediately surrounded by 3-5 staff including the manager, all assisting and asking her if she was ok or needed anything). During breakfast, there was a sweet woman making multiple rounds, checking in on everyone and everything. The food at the bar was great. Our rooms were large and very clean. Despite being on the beach, there was no musty smell or sand in the rooms. Our balconies were great and gave us a free first class seat to the fireworks show just a few hundred yards from the hotel.

"While looking for a cheap place on the fly due to change of plans, I stopped by to ask if there were any rooms available for the night. I was addressed very rudely, and the woman at the desk was not helpful at all, saying that check out was at 11am and since it was already very late it wouldnt be a good idea, and that the only rooms available were very expensive incinuating that I couldn't afford it! And then told me that if I did stay there and wasn't out by 11am, they would call the police. I have never experienced such rude service and have been basically turned down, and it was very obvious it was based on race. Very sad and disappointing. Didn't stay at this motel, and never will. Any other hotel, would probably be better.",Basically got denied service,1

"The hotel is in a good location and the restaurant had excellent food. Rooms are a bit on the small side, but still very comfy and adequate for my needs.

"We had such a great time right after the Christmas parties and family gatherings at work, home. We had a beautiful room in the new decorated section, the food at Mustangs Burros was delicious.

It was a Frittata made with Crossants ..yum.Gaby the concierge was very helpful and gave us some information for a possible wedding for our daughter. Later that evening we returned to our room to a bottle of Cabernet wine. We were very grateful to the all of the staff at the Estancia Hotel and we look forward to returning to this wounderful hotel. I almost forgot the front desk lady Erica was intuned to all of our needs, and the vallet young man made sure we had a map to our next location and gave us some water bottles for our journey.

Great overnight accommodations,Clean & comfy beds,4
"Nice, clean and comfortable rooms. The beds were comfortable, too, although more pillow options would have been even better. I like a softer pillow than what was offered, but that's my own preference. We also had some trouble with the room air conditioning system, mostly due to the remote used to operate it, which seemed simple enough and we had thought we had things running properly, until we were awakened in the night due to the room being way too stuffy. That's when we discovered the remote had a hidden flap with more buttons that we randomly pressed until the A/C fan turned on. Sometimes being high-tech can be a problem, especially without instructions. A little card in the room to explain things would have been very helpful. The hotel was nicely maintained and the lobby was warm and inviting, with friendly staff. The breakfast was yummy with a few hot options (sausage, eggs and waffles) as well as the usual breads, cereals and pastries. We would gladly stay here again.","Clean and Comfortable, but needs A/C instructions",4

The hotel staff was great as was the location. The only thing I'd say needs improvement is the actual building and rooms. The rooms seemed a bit old and could use major renovations.

"The room had no towels, when we did ask for towels they were going to send house keeping right up, that never happened. There was no TV remote, there was no ash tray (in a smoking room, nothing I would complain about usually but since there's so many others that ticked me off too) the cable line didn't even fit into the TV so all 13 of my channels barely came through. There are no movie channels so that's also a lie. The phone had no cord to the wall or to phone from the base. So when I finally did decide to complain about the towels I couldn't even call. The room was freezing, and disgusting. Was over all extremely disappointed. I wasn't expecting high class, but come on. That was horrible.",The worst.,1

"The most miserable dump I've ever had the misfortune to step into in my entire life. Let me tell you why. Spoiler: It ends with this being a mold dump. The paint on the door is peeling. Door opens and we're slammed with a wave of moldy smell that's mean as hell and thick as grass. We're dead tired and we assume that maybe we just need to run the AC or maybe we just need to leave the door open for a bit. (The door needs to be shoved closed by the way.) The light in the bathroom buzzes like a chain saw and a quick shower ends with stained towels. Or maybe they were just dirty. Early wake up the next day and we come back to the same rancid smell. I investigate and realize there is clear water damage everywhere!!! Bu the door, in the bathroom, all over the ceiling. Thrown in damaged furniture and a sink that's falling apart and you really have an A+ dump. All this on top of a real health hazard. We checked out and went somewhere else at like 11 PM.",Mold Alert!!!,1
"For a Hilton the rooms, small bathtub, and noise in the rooms was horrible. I could hear everything from the room above me and rooms next to me. This was definitely not worth 234 a night or not up to Hilton standards. I would not stay there again. The people that worked there were top class though.",Not worth the money,2
Bed Bugs!! Horrible experience. when I first arrived I they gave me such a hard time with the check in. Note that my room was paid for prior to arriving. It took me 3 hours to get everything situated. I mad this reservation about a week ago on a debit card and I've yet to see you deposit for room charges placed back on my card.

"I want to emphasize that the problems I describe here were dealt with by the overworked night staff (desk manager and shuttle bus driver/handyman who went out of their way to solve the problem of our room. I have stayed in this hotel over the years but this was worst experience and perhaps the last time. It looks as if management has cut staffing to the bone. At hotel desk I waited for nearly 20 minutes. The clerk was with a guest of the hotel who had a problem. The guest explained the problem at least five times the clerk kept forgetting details -- because he never wrote anything down -- instead repunching the same mistakes into the computer over and over again. No one else came out to help and he kept repeating mistakes. The guest, a businessman, was very patient and stepped aside to let me check-in. The clerk finally got to me. We loaded up a baggage cart and went up to the sixth floor. We found a nice room at well over 100 degrees. It is seemed as if policy is to completely turn off air conditioning between guests. Downstairs lobby was cool and pleasant. Upper level lobbies and room were very hot. Room faced afternoon sun directly unshaded. We set the AC on cool hoped for the best. I went downstairs to use the business center which is a computer in an open area with children playing on it. A child got up but no obvious reset function for privacy and screen faced a group of children hanging out.

"I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Twice! Both times we had problems with the rooms. The first time it was the room that was dirty (used condoms on the floor, found by my grandchildren) they did not come in to clean the room until 10:30pm.On July 3,2011 I also reserved 2 adjoining rooms. The outside of the Hotel was a mess. The plants and trees were all dead. The inside was being remolded and was okay. They workers kept it nice and clean. The girls at the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing! It took two of them to figure where we were supposed to stay and how to charge us. I ended up getting overcharged for the rooms and to make matters worse I was double charged. When I called them, I left a message for the someone to call me back. They said it would be in a half hour. Well one and a half hours later I had to call. They would not put me through to the manager. They even hung up on me. Mind you I was not that upset at that time. I just wwanted to get someone to take care of the problem without me having to tell 5 people. Give me the right one the first time. I finally got the desk manager and she wanted to call me back, I told her no I would not take that chance. She said she would look it up and call me back. Now I am waiting for her call. Wish me luck!Now mind you the hotel was being remodeled and that was fine. But the pool area was dirty! There were glasses on all of the tables and towels laying around. (actually we should pick up after ourselfs). the water was not clean and not clear. We did take our towels out of the rooms with us and took them back in. We asked the desk for clean ones and we got them right away brought to our room. It was 1:p.m. when we were in the pool. this Holiday Inn is the olny hotel close to my brothers house.

"This was an okay hotel, but for a Marriott, I was a little disappointed. I was in town for a race at Texas Motor Speedway. First off, this is a great location if you're attending a race there. With heavy traffic, the drive was only about 30 minutes from the hotel to the TMS parking lot. The staff at this hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful, plus the food at the hotel restaurant/bar was delicious although a little pricey (which should be expected). The room (single king bed) was well appointed and included a moderately sized TV and mini fridge. Within walking distance, there is a sandwich shop, a pizzeria/Italian restaurant, and a liquor store. If you're looking for any late night entertainment or food, you'll have to settle for the hotel bar or drive elsewhere. As for some negatives from my stay, the thermostat for my room did not work and it was bit warmer in my room than I would have liked. Additionally, my room had several pill bugs crawling around the room. Finally, I was disappointed that the hotel charged for Wi-fi and internet connection. Overall, my stay was okay and I'd be willing to give this hotel a second chance considering its close proximity to the racetrack.",Average to good hotel near Texas Motor Speedway,3

Although it was expensive, or more than most venues, it was worth every penny. The staff, especially Rosa Falu, their wedding coordinator, was incredible. Although it rained and we could not marry out on the lawn overlooking the beautiful rock formations, they have a gorgeous terrace that was still wonderful and romantic. There were deer on the lawn in the midst and the guests sipped hot chocolate in September. The food was delicious and the cake was the best anyone had ever tasted.

"Myself and my wife stayed at this resort Oct.18th-24th, 2015 with a total of 4 couples. Pros: Overall, we loved this resort. The standard rooms are amazing, the resort grounds is wonderful. My wife is a very picky eater and had concerns that she wouldn't be able to find many options for her to eat, which has been a problem at other resorts in the past. She had no problems with the food. The restaurant food was great. The staff was always there to help. At times it seems like there was more staff than patrons. Cons: We had very few complaints. The beach does have a seaweed problem, which is all over the area currently. The resort was out everyday removing seaweed. The resort was doing everything they could to take care of the problem. I can't blame the resort for this issue. The resort has 5 hot tubs. The hot tubs were never very hot, especially during the daytime. We were disappointed in that area. Currently the closest men's restroom to the pool was under construction, so you had to walk a long way from the pool area to find a restroom. The last complaint we had was the pools and hot tubs closed at 8pm. This would be a easy fix. Overall, we enjoyed the resort and plan on returning in the future.",Great place to vacation!,5

The staff is uneducated and clearly lacks customer service knowledge.Dear palmers1800,As I have mentioned on the many other reviews that you have written, I do apologize that we were not able to accommodate your gift certificate this past weekend. Gift certificates are donated as a courtesy to many charitable events that are important to the St. James Hotel family. On the gift certificates, we do specify that they can not be used over special event periods and are for standard rooms. Unfortunately, this past weekend was a special event and we only had 1 room available at the time we spoke which was our King Suite. I do require all gift certificates to be approved through me so I sincerely apologize if you received the incorrect information through our front desk staff. Christie, Assistant GM, began her career at the St. James only a few weeks ago and was not yet familiar with our policies and procedures regarding gift certificates. We would be more than happy to accommodate you in future. Please reach out to me directly at the below direct line.

Horrible hotel with no security between rooms. The owner was on vacation and the assistant general manager failed to answer his cell phone.

"We were a group of 8 ladies aging from 23 - 64. We checked in on a Friday, the room wasn't quite ready so took the shuttle over to the Marriott World Center for a poolside lunch. My only negative of our stay was that the front desk was suppose to call/text when our room was ready and they didn't. We ate, roamed around World Center for a bit and shuttled back. Once back, we napped in the lobby for nearly an hour before I checked in with the front desk and yes, our room was indeed ready. We had a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom unit with a living room, dining room and kitchen which was plenty big for our party. Everyone we encountered was more than pleasant and went out of their way to greet us. We used the main pool on a Sunday which was not crowded at all. The store in the main building was complete in their offerings of drinks, snacks, fruit and pre-packaged meals as well as suntan lotions and basic toiletries. The location is perfect for a Disney vacation and a short Uber ride to the Universal Parks. This was our second stay in the Marriott complex and we look forward to our next visit.Welcome back!

"The hotel was in a perfect location for us because of where we had to go to that evening (less than 1 mile away). However, the hotel location as in an older run down area. The rooms were clean and well kept, but once outside the room, we did not feel safe in the hotel/motel because the security parking gate and stairways were left wide open all night. Overall, the room was OK, but the hotel safety was a question mark for us. One good thing is that Bob's Hawaiian Food is right next door and has the best Hawaiian food around.","Clean rooms, but hotel safety a concern",3
"We booked this on a last minute visit to the area, we were looking for a good value. The reviews were half way decent, but when we arrived, were disappointed in the rooms. The bathroom had a mold ring around the toilet and significant mildew on the walls and floor. The bed seemed dirty as well, but I could have been more aware after seeing the bathroom. The hotel was full and it was late at night so we did not make arrangements for another room. I would not stay there again.",I expected better based on reviews,2

"Hotel was generally excellent. Sea view rooms looked great. Our room was on the side and had a terrible view of unsightly side of hotel next door. On reflection we should have asked to be moved but didn't bother as only there for a couple of days would definitely be worth paying more for the stunning view of port and cathedral. Had breakfast one day which was very good but quite expensive at 29 per person-would have been cheaper if we had included breakfast when we booked. Room facilities v good. Good wifi in room, lovely bed. Quite a long walk into town but very easy to hail a taxi if needed and not expensive at around 5. Would go back.",Lovely traditional hotel -Great  seafront position,4
"You can't say enough about the staff! We were first greeted by James, who came out, helped park the car, proceeded to get the luggage out of the trunk with care and take it in to the hotel and up to the room. He was very helpful in getting our room set up for us(a/c, frig, ect.). Working the front desk to check us in was Tori. He checked us in quickly, helped with mapping out points of interest, places to eat and things to do. We also had the pleasure of another front desk personally, Miss Danielle. Just as energetic and helpful as Tori and James. They helped make serveral reservations, ect. for us. There is nothing this staff of friendly, energy packed, helpful, willing to go beyond the norm, caring people will not do to make your stay the best experience possible. Making you feel like family is an asset! Caring about your day, experience, helping you get the best out of your time in New Orleans is what drives them. We can not say enough of the staff, not to mention that the hotel sets in walking destance to WWII Museum, River Walk, and the French Market just to name a few. We give them a 2 THUMBS UP! And we will be back!!!",Family Feeling with Great Location,5

"I had a very pleasant 2 night stay at the diva- if given the choice I would give it 3.5 as I think it was better than average. I chose the hotel for its close location to union square and it's value price compared to a lot of other hotels in the area. Whether this hotel is for you really depends on what you want..I stayed one night in the Hilton parc 55 which had a lot more amenities and the 'posh ' vibe and then moved to the cheaper hotel diva as I couldn't afford 3 nights in the Hilton. I actually prefered the diva because of its great location and found the service in the diva a lot better than the Hilton. The diva bed was also more comfy than the Hilton and overall I felt the diva was much better value. If you are looking for value and a good location then this hotel is for you, if you want a grand hotel with a lot of amenities with a view to spending a lot of time in the hotel itself, then the Hilton would be more up your street.

We originally booked for 2 nights. We decided we wanted to add a night on but they didn't have our room available for 3 nights. So we did one night in one room and two in the other. It didn't bother me. The hotel staff was fantastic. They called me at 10 am on Friday to tell me that my main room was ready and they made sure the room was close so it wasn't too hard to transfer our belongings. It was clean and a lot of amenities. The pool was a perfect temperature and the court yard was great. House keeping did a great job and the free breakfast buffet was a huge bonus.

Had asked for rollaway and mattress was ripped all down the side with guts of mattress hanging out. No sheets or blanket were left. Called for the sheets and was told I would have to go back to the desk to get them. Coffee maker was broke. The people that stayed prior to us had filled it wth water. Machine was broke so it was left that way. It leaked all over the tea and coffee packets. Ice machine was broke on our floor. The hallways were dirty and had not been vacuumed and also had stains.

We shared a room with our daughter and son-in-law, a very spacious room with two queen beds in a separate room, plus a comfortable to sleep on sofa.

The hotel has great technology, lighting controlled with your room card as soon as you enter the room, a great TV in both rooms, and a very nice kitchen island to sit at and eat our awesome cheesecake we got to bring back for a snack.

Free breakfast was included in our stay the food was varied, plentiful, and excellent quality.

"Hotel has a nice lobby and check-in was nice and quick. Had a morning flight in and got to the hotel by 12 PM. They had my room ready and they were able to accommodate my request to be on the same floor as my brother's room. The room itself was just right for a family of four and the bathroom was a very nice size to accommodate the girl's toiletries and the boy's minimal essentials. Bathroom had tub separate from a nice size shower stall. As for the hotel location, only a block away from Pacific Place mall which had restaurants and a movie theater. The hotel was also only 7 blocks away from Pike Place Market which we practically went to every day. Very convenient to public transportation to and from airport as well as to the Space Needle.

We booked the hotel for the pool. My children and I went to the pool ready for a swim and found the pool room very cold (perhaps 55 degrees). We asked thedesk personell and she told us they were closing the pool the next day so that was as good as it got. The water temperature was too cold for a swim. Please know that we are accustomed to swimming in the frigid waters of the gulf of Maine. We went in the hot tub only to have a traffic of employees come through to open the door to the outside (20 degrees) for a smoke break. The smoke and cold came into our area and this ended our pool experience.,it had a pool ready for polar bears,3

"My wife and a number of her co-workers were staying here for 2 weeks while working at the nearby convention center, I decided to tag along for 5 nights. The rooms come equipped with a small kitchen which is good for extended stays, however you would need a car as there is no grocery store within walking distance. The hotel is about a mile from Disneyland and the convention center, but is reight beside Angels Stadium and has some decent restaurants within walking distance. The biggest issue I had with the hotel is the noise from the trains passing by as the rail line is directly behind the hotel. The temperature was very comfortable in the evening so we left the windows open, big mistake. I was awakened at 4.30am by a train going through with its horn blaring, if you've seen My Cousin Vinnie it was pretty much like that. Having traveled from the east coast I was then wide awake. Trains start coming through on a regular basis after that, pretty much every 1/2 hour or hour. A number of people in our group had the same issues and resorted to Ambien to try and sleep through.","Decent hotel, but light sleepers be warned......",3
"We stayed Saturday night at Aloft after the 76ers game. The hotel is fun and young. Loud urban music plays throughout which makes it feel like a dance party! The room is modern and unique with the bathroom area directly behind the bed. We had a great view of liftoff too! We had a few drinks at the bar, played pool and even Connect Four. We had a great time with no complaints. There is a 7 charge for parking though. We were about 10 minutes from the game.Thank you for your review of the Aloft, PHL Airport.

Still, the room was fine, the bedding good, and the cleanliness what you'd expect for a higher end hotel. Not sure what's up with the very loud air conditioning, though. Even on its lowest fan setting, the noise level was so high that my husband and I had to raise our voices to be heard.

"I have never written a review like this and thought the previous reviewers were exaggerating or just expecting too much from a Holiday Inn Express. I was wrong. Clearly, the hotel is trying very hard to cover up an unpleasant smell, and with no way to open a window or gain access to fresh air, the smell is truly overwhelming. When we first arrived, I thought the smell in the lobby was bad (a combination of stale smoke, damp must, and something they have sprayed to try to cover it up) but the smell in our room was even worse. There was no relief from it because the windows are sealed shut and it was too late for us to find another hotel.",Overwhelming smell throughout,1

スタッフの対応、設備は文句なしで最高でした。近くのショッピングセンターまで、徒歩圏内ですが、女性二人だったため、ホテルマンがショッピングセンターまでエスコートしてくれるほど、気配りがありました。ただ、帰りは、すぐ近くといえども、女性二人で歩くのは危険なので、タクシーが必要でした。ホテルの前は大通りということもあり、渋滞が酷く、ほんの2、3分の場所でも、１５分かかってしまう感じだったので、立地で選ぶのであれば、fxの方が良いと感じました。ただ、ホテルに戻って、リラックスしたいという目的があれば、お勧めします。ホテル内は、まるでエステのような良い匂いが漂っており、プールも綺麗で空いておりリラックスできました。,素晴らしいサービス,5

"Let me start with the positives. Its located next to the Tropicana. Now the negatives. It started with the 1920's elevator. You only need to ride it once to prefer climbing the stairs. It shimmies and sways for the whole ride. The stairwell and halls are dark. Thank goodness for the pink neon lights. The room was small but it was relatively clean. No stains on the beds or towels like other people found. They call this the social end of the hotel. First, its a motel and second, social means.. people that pay for rooms by the hour. Normally when you check out of a hotel, the desk clerk asks how your stay was... I guess they don't ask questions they don't want to answer to. If we had only paid 60 or less for the room I wouldn't be complaining. We got a living social deal and it was too much for this room. So if you can get this room for less than 60 then its worth it if for nothing else but the location.

"My Fiance and I stayed at the Plaza Hotel in Downtown Vegas and we weren't expecting much from this older hotel. When we arrived there on Friday afternoon they only had ONE bellman and ONE Valet attendant. It was busy with everyone coming in for the weekend and they were clearly overwhelmed. Once the bellman arrived to take our luggage (after a good 25 minutes), we waited in the Check-in line for 30 MINUTES! They only had TWO people working in the counter and the ONE manager that they had was dealing with another guests who was very irritated by the fact that her air conditioner was not working. Upon finally making it to the counter the lady who is helping us coughs on our credit cards and says that she thinks she's getting sick because she has the chills. WHAT THE HECK!! Thanks for your contaminating our stuff you virus on legs! Once we finally got to our room in the 17th floor we immediately washed our hands and face so we wouldn't sick only to find that the bathroom hadn't been restocked with towels! The ice bucket had a wet paper towel already in it..yuck! The poor bellman who was by himself took another 30 minutes to bring us our things.

"I stayed at the Marriott Vacation Club Pulse during Memorial Day weekend from the Bay Area. Unfortunately, I had pulled my hamstring prior to my arrival and was in extreme pain after walking through 2 airports and pulling my luggage. The hotel staff took me to my room in a wheelchair and brought me ice and other items to assist with my pain. On top of that, they gave me a Get Well card signed by all the staff. The room is nice (not too big and not too small) and the furniture is well appointed. The bathroom is a really great size with the closets located inside the restroom along the wall (nice touch). Before I arrived I read the reviews where other travelers complained about a reflection on the sliding door that separates the living room from the bedroom at night. I did not experience that. I enjoyed the indoor pool/jacuzzi and the close proximity to the Donut Bar (the donuts are splendid), the House of Blues, as well as other restaurants, banks and stores. The street it is located on is more quaint than lively, but you're a stone's throw away from the action. The room service is great ( I ordered breakfast a couple of mornings) as well and the delivery team makes sure you're satisfied. They also have a discount card avail (not sure it's available to all traveler profiles) that you can use at nearby restaurants which was a plus.

"San Diego, being one of our favorite places, we decided to try Estancia.The hotel is tucked away off the main road, a short car ride from La Jolla, the beach, Del Mar Racing, Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve and several golf courses. I adored the lush grounds and the Spanish/Ranch style architecture. We had a lovely, sunny comfortable room overlooking the fountain courtyard which made it very peaceful. The staff was amazing, they deserve 5 Stars! They are friendly, engaging and genuinely want to make your visit a memorable experience. I'm not usually a fan of hotel restaurants, but breakfast on the veranda overlooking the courtyard was delightful and yummy. The hotel was busy the holiday week we visited, two weddings and several meetings along with resort guests like ourselves. We were concerned that it might get noisy. It was never an issue, we were not disturbed by any of the activities, we actually enjoyed the quartet playing at one of the ceremonies below in the courtyard. On Thursday, we had an interesting Landscape Tour provided by the hotel plant lady, which also gave some of the hotel history. I think it's noteworthy to mention Estancia's environmentally friendly practices, I appreciate businesses respecting our planet. I hated to leave this tranquil, enchanting environment, but can't wait to return.Dear Nina92515,Thank you for choosing to stay at Estancia and for taking the time to share your comments.

The atmosphere of Lamonthe House was completely tranquil in a big city, steps from Bourbon, the streetcar, and Frenchman streets. The pool and courtyard, as well as our private patio right outside our room was superb. Strongly recommend this to visitors visiting New Orleans who need a place to recover from their long walks and party ventures. Only critique items would be that the hot tub portion of the swimming pool could have been cleaned more often, with particles accumulating to not so pleasing levels. Also, there was a periodic smell in the bathroom which probably came through the pipes, but it didn't stay around for long periods or creep into the room. Also could not accommodate a 1 hr late checkout for some reason, which put us in a bit of a panic on our last morning.",Great secluded hideaway in the city,5

"Arriving in the middle of the afternoon on a business trip, I chose to forego grabbing fast food at the airport, and instead took my shuttle directly to the Renaissance Waverly Hotel. Big mistake. After a quick (and delightful) check-in, I rushed up to my King-sized room and changed clothes, hoping to run back downstairs and grab a very late lunch/early dinner. No such luck. No cafe or restaurant in the hotel was open during the day except for very specific lunch hours (11a - 2p). I was out of luck until 5:30pm - more than 2 hours away. I was famished! So I went back downstairs and put my credit card on file so I could order room service with its ridiculous delivery fee and separate room service charge. I know most hotels do this, but for a convention center with travelers arriving at all hours of the day, at least have a coffee/snack shop open! So far, this has left a bad taste in my mouth (because I am still waiting for room service, it's all I've had in my mouth!)I really appreciate your feedback and agree with you that you should be able to get a bite to eat in the afternoon. When the restaurant is closed we have Tosca Blu (lounge) open and do serve a pretty extensive menu. I am very sorry we did not make that clear to you and will follow up with my team. Please call me when you are coming back to town, I would like to take special care of you the next time you are with us!",Don't Skip Lunch Thinking You Can Grab Something When You Check In!,3

"My girlfriend and I stayed here as a alternative to staying at the Casino. The biggest fail was the parking. They basically force you to pay for valet. There is public parking a couple blocks away that costs 6/day, but the valet was 10/day. Which I was cool with, but there was only one valet attendant. We stood there for awhile until I finally went in to ask to get my car parked. When we checked out, they had no idea where the keys were. I had to go into the key room and find my keys. So, yeah might wanna fine tune that process. Other than that, it was as good as it could of been for what we paid for. We had breakfast down in the restaurant which took about 30- 40 min to get our food. There was only 1 waitress working. She did as good as 1 person could do. We felt bad for her. We will stay again, I mean its Battle Creek for crying out loud. You get what you pay for!",Going through the motions,3

"I stayed at Hotel Sorrento for 6 nights in September. I loved the character and charm of this hotel. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. It was 5-star service, particularly with the friendly doormen always assisting and welcoming guests.The lobby and fireplace room are so cozy and atmospheric. Loved the wine hour they put on each evening. Drinks and breakfast were excellent, too. When the weather cooperated, we enjoyed sitting outside around the fire. The location was perfect, a quick jaunt to the main attractions and the convention center, but away from the hustle and bustle. It is a downhill walk to Pike Place Market and surrounds.. so we enjoyed walking down there, walking around, and then taking Uber back to the hotel once we were tired. Also enjoyed being a short walk to Capitol Hill. We loved that they changed the carpets in the elevator each day. Just another example of Sorrento's panache. Our room was clean, quiet, charming, and comfortable. Loved everything about this stay!The word panache is simply not used enough! We love it as a descriptive for the Sorrento! Thank you for all the lovely feedback, especially in regards to the service. Our team wants to relay how much they value our guests, and we are always happy when it shows. It sounds like you were able to enjoy the best of both worlds during your stay. The Fireside is such a wonderful space for when it is cold or dreary and the Garden and the fire pit is such a treat when the rain decides to stay away. We couldnt be happier that you enjoyed your stay. We hope to see you again if you are in our neighborhood in the future!",What more could you want Hotel Sorrento makes for a perfect Seattle stay.,5

"Hotel was clean and room size was fine. Mini fridge and microwave in room were a plus. Pool area was nice with good sized pool and fitness equipment. Restaurant food was good (we got a 14 credit to use for breakfast between the three of us so it still cost 20) but service was very slow. The first floor, which we walked through to get to the elevator, reeked of cigarette smoke. This can be avoided by parking out back or using the stairs. My biggest complaint was the WIFI. I paid for a hotel rather than camping because I needed WIFI to get some work done. While I could get my phone to connect, my computer would not recognize the free signal. After 20 minutes on hold with the tech support group, the answer that I got was to sit next to the door. This worked to connect but the signal dropped again once I moved back into the room. The promise that they would reset the signal did not seem to be kept as this was an issue both nights I was there.

"This was our first trip to Branson. The hotel is old. Carpet was frayed, chair was saggy, room was damp and musty. Breakfast was gross and not much to pick from. The room was clean, so that was a plus. Would not stay here again, as there seemed to be plenty other places to pick from for the same or better pricing. The location was good, as we were able to walk to some shows and restaurants.",Not impressed,2

"I can't say enough about this boutique hotel in the center of all the action. This hotel has been recently updated and it's even cleaner, prettier, and friendlier than it was. Everyone has a smile and is always trying to make your stay perfect. They upgraded us because they knew it was our 40th anniversary. Cassie at the front desk remembered us each day when we entered the lobby. People of all sorts , with pets, with kids, same sex couples, young and old. I love the wonderful mix of incredible people. This is how Chicago should be seen. And you are only steps from the best shopping in town on state street and the best theater in the Midwest.

"I travel often to San Francisco (1-2 times a month) and while recently planning on going with my friends for a vacation I booked at Hotel Abri. Trying to save money, I found a decent deal for a hotel that had good reviews here. While not going into further detail, but noting that I had difficulty in checking-in due to housekeeping being short-staffed, there was much issue.The BIGGEST issue I had here was with getting spider bites from sleeping on the sofa bed. After showing the front desk, and after their inspection came out negative, they moved me rooms, but that was it. I still haven't heard back from a manager and was not offered any sort of compensation.I would suggest not going cheap and staying at the Parc 55 across the street.Dear Luke H.,Thank you for your time and for providing us with the details of your experience while staying with us at Hotel AbRi, I want to let you know that I am aware of the multiple interactions/communications with you regarding your check in, stay and insect bites, I want to assure you again that we have followed up with the staff and pest control teams with the same procedures as we communicated to you at the end of your stay that there was no evidence of pests in the room, after our professional vendor inspected and treated the room, we also provided you with the findings and communication. I want to again formally apologize to you and your guests for the multiple interactions and confusion regarding the check in, as our check in time is 3:00pm, however we always try to accommodate guests requests, and our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests, we were sold out the night before and also on the day of your arrival the requests are challenging to grant as our check out time is 12 noon. Also our apologies for the confusion on your reservation made by the third party which provided you with a One deluxe room with double double beds, not a two bedroom room, as stated, our front desk team did upgrade you to one of our Urban Suites to provide you with more space and a better stay for you and your guests. I am very sorry that even with the steps we took to upgrade your room type we failed to provide you a great stay, as this situation does not reflect our Hotel AbRis core values, style or caring approach, we totally understand your point of view, but we would like to let you know that our teams are diligently working with our third party partners to resolve these type of situations, so it would not affect other guests as it affected you. However this is not an excuse for the actions or scenario you described, during your stay we really tried to provide you with all the upgraded amenities our Urban welcome provides, but as we can see we fail on the communication and we will work on getting better. I can assure you that the sequences of events you have presented are not in any way, our teams guest service standards or company goals. I want you to know our leadership and service team have followed the procedures as we are truly concern and sadden by the details of your experience, and we want to again apologize on this format as we have done for the past days during communications with you. I would like to request from you another opportunity to further discuss and try to turn this situation from a negative experience to a positive, as we value our guests feedback. Please feel free to contact me directly at 415-392-8800, we are anxious to show you the caring, casual and family atmosphere we promote in our Hotel. Thank you again for your feedback and I look forward to speaking with you. Have a great day!EJ Varela Hotel Manager",Got 4-6 Spider bites while staying here...,1

Another trip. We have stayed here for at least 4 years and this was a firstThank you for taking the time to let us know about your concerns with our BRAND. I have discussed this situation with my entire staff to ensure it is not repeated. We assure you this kind of incident is not the way we conduct business. Our goal is to provide a level of service that requires diligent attention to detail and is a matter of constant reinforcement of our hotel. Once again, we are truly sorry for the inconvenience we caused you. If there is anything else we can assist you with in the future, please don't hesitate to call. We look forward to having you as our guest in the future.Willis Blake DOS",Slight Improvement needed,2
The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a wonderful view of the beach and you can see the fireworks from the balcony. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner but the room was overall clean. The beds were definitely comfortable. The door that separates the two rooms were unlocked unfortunately. The people in the other room opened our door and of course we were not expecting someone walking through that door since it is normally locked. I did not bother to check if it was locked when we first got to the room. I just assumed it was always locked. Lesson learned for sure.,Nice hotel close to the beach,4

"Right next to the shopping my wife loves on Union Sq. and the older more staid hotels of SF like the St. Francis is the Diva. I went to SF for a business conference the St. Francis but decided I wanted to get away from the business crowd somewhat. Diva was a perfect choice. It was a block from the conference but a whole different atmosphere. From the famous guests prints in the concrete to the lights in the elevator and the curtains on the wall the Diva was fun. Staff was friendly and focused and the bed was comfortable. I'll definately do it again.Dear Ian J,Thank you for staying at Hotel Diva.

"When we first looked at our room, it looked as expected. Clean, etc. When we used the bathroom however, I noticed that everything was very very low to the ground: toilet, shower sink counter--So much so that I had to bend my knees and strain my back to reach my hands under the faucet to wash my hands. Kind of annoying since standard counter height for bathrooms now is 36. This counter height was around 26-27 high so I was not happy with that part. Also, water pressure was very low--so that was also annoying. When I woke up---I had bites on my arm that weren't there the night before when I went to sleep. When I went to check out in the morning -- I told the hotel employees about this. The man behind the counter said that since I booked with Hotels.com, they weren't able to do anything compensatory like a discount, etc. First of all---I never asked for a discount or compensation. Besides, it's not a Hotels.com issue---it's a Best Western issue! Later the manager did call me and thanked me for letting them know. He said he would call me back after a thorough room inspection. He never did. Two days later, the bites are still there---but are now healing. I was grossed out and worried about bringing whatever that was back to my house! Also--breakfast was practically inedible. They were out of everything anyway because they were super crowded due to the end-of-breakfast stampede. Suggestion--extend the weekend breakfast hours or start later on the weekends.",Bed bugs and More,2

"This is the 3rd time staying at the hotel, so obviously we like it. The location is not too far from L.A. for a quick getaway. I think the price can be a bit high, we only stay if we get a good deal and so try to book early and with a AAA discount.The grounds are beautiful, it feels like a Hacienda. The pool is fairly large as is the jacuzzi. There's nice lounge chairs and it never seems too crowded. A good mix of young, old, families, business people having conferences, etc...No one will feel out of place. It is on the quite/reserved side though so I'm not sure how much kids would like it. We usually stay here with our teenagers when we're doing something in San Diego or La Jolla (water skiing, snorkeling, etc...) otherwise I think they would be a bit bored too.Food is fairly expensive, we usually try to do the Mustang's happy hour and then eat out other meals. I don't think I would recommend the food if we paid the full price vs. happy hour prices. The lengua tacos were fabulous as were the chicken wings. Moscow Mule was delicious, but it was strange they ran out of copper mugs. The bar/restaurant was very empty but they had to take our mugs from us at the table and refill for the second round. Service was friendly and fast.Rooms are comfortable, this time we stayed in basic room and didn't have a balcony which I missed. It's pretty to sit out and view their landscaping/fountains, etc..It feels very secluded. They provide you with a bottle of wine in the room which is a nice touch.Gym isn't large but has what you need- about 7 or 8 cardio machines, a few weight machines and free weights. It got a little full, but we were able to do our full routines both days with no issues.There were just a couple of negatives: self parking is so expensive at 25.00 a day. I really wish hotels would just add that in to the nightly room fee along with the resort fees. Each night ends up being 50 more when you add in extras like being able to park your car. Also they offered free coffee/tea service in the mornings but from like 5-6:30 a.m. in the morning which is insane. Who wakes up at 5 in the morning on vacation Either offer the coffee/tea at a normal time which is a minimal cost to the hotel and garners good will to guests or take it away.Dear bakeshop,Thank you for being a frequent and loyal guest at Estancia we're thrilled to be your hotel of choice when visiting the San Diego area. It's wonderful to hear how much you enjoy the peacefulness and beauty of our award-winning grounds, along with the comfortable luxury of our guest rooms, and the friendly hospitality of our staff.

"We were invited to the wedding of a close family member in San Diego with only 3 weeks notice. A friend got us two rooms at Rodeway Inn Qualcomm at a discounted rate to help us with travel expenses. We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements.

Stayed here in October for my cousins Bachelor party and for a bunch of mid 20 party goers we found this hotel to be perfect as it is right on bourbon street and in the French quarter of New Orleans. Locations was key for us and this was literally the perfect location as we only stayed on bourbon for the majority of our trip. The rooms weren't the most spacious but it was enough for four people. The pool area was outside and small. If you're looking for a quiet and relaxing getaway this might not be the place for you as the noise can spill into the hotel rooms that face bourbon street but rooms that face the side streets are somewhat quieter. Overall good stay and would return no questions asked. Thanks CostasDaGreek for taking the time to review your stay with us at the Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter. We are happy to see you enjoyed your time in New Orleans for the Bachelor Party and stay with us. We welcome you back anytime!,Bachelor party weekend,4

It was beautiful, modern and I felt comfortable as I walked in. We purchased some waters from the gift shop as we were driving around through Napa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. Kalah (I believe that was her name- she had curly brown hair), was so warm upon us walking into the lobby. I asked if I could take a look around just to see what the common areas looked like, she said absolutely! It was beautiful. I am looking forward to my future stay(s) here. I will say as I passed a young lady, Danielle. It was like she did not want to be there or she was having an off day. She did not acknowledge me as a guest as she passed by or even at the desk. Overall still 5 Stars. Kalah (hopefully that was her name) was AWESOME! See you Soon!Dear LeMoura G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Your comments especially the Wow are bells to my ears. We truly do have a unique Hampton capturing the Napa Valley throughout the building. It was very satisfying to hear your awesome comments about Kalah. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar.",Amazing and Beautiful Property and Kalah was Awesome!,5

My friend and I came to Paris for some sightseeing and fell in love with the neighborhood where this hotel is located. This hotel was a nice treat during our visit. The staff was very friendly. There were no language barriers as we feared. The location was close to the metro. The rooms were really clean and fresh. The cleaning staff even came back to clean our rooms when we left really late one day. The elevator is small as the reviews say but it served its purpose anyway.

"Horrible. Do not stay in this hotel! First they didnt bother accommodating us with 1 bed (couple) and instead gave us 2 smaller beds. (We were there during the week and there were many available rooms). The front desk was rude ( I assume they get nasty from dealing with people but all we did was ask a simple question and they were rude about it). The bathtub was clogged, we asked to unclog it and they left a mess without cleaning it up. Dirt all over the tub, and it gets worse. The bathtub still remained clogged after their snaking attempt. The lights in the room are bad, they only had 2 lamps and no ceiling light so room remained with little light. THEY CHARGE A HIDDEN FEE! We stayed for 3 nights and we got charged 82 in extra fees without warning. We have stayed in many hotels before and they usually warn us when there are parking fees or any fees. This hotel did not mention any extra fees. The elevator was disgusting, someone urinated all over the inside of elevator.",Horrible Hotel! Beware of filth and rudeness.,1

"We booked for a July stay based on an affordable rate, location, and the generally positive reviews we'd seen. The staff was pleasant upon check-in, but we were a bit disappointed with the old feeling of the room, lack of light in the shower, etc. We were out and about most of the afternoon and evening, and when I pulled back the covers to get in bed at about 11:30, a reddish-brown bug was trying to scurry out of sight. I caught it and confirmed in an online image search that it was indeed a bedbug. We tore up the covers and found another. Out of curiosity, we looked at the other bed in the room and didn't see any, but we did notice it was wrapped in a mattress cover that our bed didn't have...perhaps evidence that someone knew there was a problem (which obviously wasn't eradicated) We'd heard bedbug infestation horror stories so we packed everything up, called the night manager to tell her we would be seeking alternate accommodations and dropped our key in the slot. The night manager advised us to talk to another manager in the morning. The next morning my husband talked to the manager and although she was reluctant to give us a complete refund (citing Expedia fees, etc), she did agree and we received a refund. After returning home from our trip we called to request additional compensation for our trouble of leaving to find another (more expensive) hotel at midnight but not surprisingly didn't get a response. Fortunately we didn't bring any bugs home with us.",Beware of bedbugs,2
"I would never stay in a hotel where they don't have the courtesy of us staying 5 nights and they don't give allowance to stay over a couple hours past the check out time of 12:00 noon.

This hotel though not updated or as modern as others in the area felt cozy and just right. The staff was very professional and warm as well as helpful. Our favorites were Amy, Christina and Michell at the front desk. You will find that the towels are a bit worn and stiff but plenty are provided and are clean and fresh. When we ran out of fresh washcloths some were sent to our room within minutes. We went on a quiet week so we experienced no noise even though we were situated close to the elevator on the second floor. I can't forget to mention the breakfast tray brought to our room each morning, we enjoyed the hot coffee, warm croissants with melted butter as well as the orange juice and jelly. This was probably my favorite perk of this hotel.

We recently stayed two nights at the property. It was towards the end of a two week driving vacation. The location of the property was good for us and folks we know were very impressed with them. I got my expectations a bit elevated. The property is doing some renovations to their restaurant area so I was visually disappointed on arrival. We had to wait about an hour for a room to become available. We were assigned room 102. Getting to the room with luggage was not a comfortable process using a luggage cart. Very tight quarters. Once in the room I determined there was no cell signal for my Verizon phone and internet device. I approached the front desk and explained my situation. I don't feel I was dealt with in an honest or courteous manner. I requested a room change after being told that cell service is not generally a problem on the property. That was not correct. The new room was a weak signal but it was acceptable. The new room (143) was missing the phone which they replaced once notified. We were given a 25 gift card for the restaurant which we happily disposed of in the bar. That was very comfortable and the staff in there were quite nice. We're home now and I don't think I would stay there again if in the area.,A bit disappointing stay,4

"Checking in was the worst part of my experience. As I was standing in line to check in, there was one person in front of me who was being assisted and two other guests in line behind me also waiting to check in with only one front desk employee. I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. That frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available. In the end it all worked out, but the my being neglected at check-in and her room not being ready are two things that you should never experience at a hotel like the St. Regis. Yes the rooms are nice, yes the hotel is well maintained, but the service is for me the most important, and the service that I experienced was slightly below average.

The location is great, the staff is fantastic, and arranged for our transportation from the airport when we arrived and to the train station when we left. The public areas and rooms were lovely. The 30 euro breakfast was delightful. Really the only thing that seemed odd was that the lobby and hallways are not air conditioned, and the a/c in our rooms was barely adequate.

The best thing about the hotel is the location. The room was clean but bathroom is in great need of refurbishing. The walls had black marks on them and need either a really good cleaning or fresh coat of paint. The shower tiles have been painted and the paint is peeling on the windowsill so you could see the original color.

There's paid parking nearby but we walked everywhere except two days when we took a taxi to the WWII museum for 10 and to NOMA for 15.

"Was travelling down to San Francisco on business and booked two hotel rooms at the last minute - all paid and confirmed...or so we thought.

Hotel was supposed to find us rooms elsewhere but we ended up scrambling to find two other rooms. Disappointed as we always like to try and find the hidden jewel but this time we certainly found something else. Guess squatters rights still exist in San Francisco!Dear Nathan M-Let me first say that I appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback following your recent experience with us. Secondly, let me apologize and say that I wish that we were able to have accomodated you and your colleague at the Hotel Abri. Not being able to honor a reservation for a guest is the least desireable and most difficult situation for the hotel as well as the guest. We had a group of rooms extend that caused us a bit of a situation. I believe that when you arrived we were in the middle of securing accomodations for you at a neighboring hotel, but I understand how disappointing this was as you had already picked the Abri and we were unable to welcome you in the way we wish we could have. I hope that when your travels return you to San Francisco, you will give us a second chance. Please feel free to contact me or the hotel directly for future reservations, as we have a lowest rate guarantee, and always offer the lowest rate available thru any booking channel.

this hotel had black mould at the back of the toilet not a little the whole back. The rugs are dirty and when we took a shower the water wouldn't drain so we stood in ankle deep water it did drain next day. The beds were comfortable and seemed clean. We stayed only one nite and if we had an alternative we would have went else where also we were tired and exhausted from our day of travel. They put us in a basement room when the majority of the hotel was empty. The breakfast was not as good as some of the Super 8s in which we stayed at during this trip across Canada and United States. We also had trouble with payment which we had to pay them again as your visa did not work as they explained to us apparently we are to get a refund from you in three days.

"This was a spontaneous overnight stop due to anticipated bad weather. I booked online very late the night before and was shocked to get such a great deal. As it turns out, there was an error in the price listing. The hotel honored the rate and the customer service was outstanding. I wasn't able to take advantage of most of the amenities, so I can't speak to the condition of the pool/whirlpool or continental breakfast. The room was very clean and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay. (There's a 24-hour Walmart located next door so I was able to pick up any overnight items I needed there.) The small fridge in the room made a loud noise, but I was able to quiet it by sliding a thick piece of cardboard under one of the corners. My only criticism is that the mattress was much too firm for MY personal preference. (I have chronic lower back pain and own a Sleep Number bed, which I keep between 35 and 45 on a scale of 1-100, with 100 being maximum firmness.)

The staff all seemed eager to help and please. The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests. I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also, considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruise.The free breakfast was also a bonus as it wasn't your usual boring continental breakfast offerings. They had different items on each of the mornings we were there. Some were: Omelettes, sausage, biscuits, bacon and warm cinnamon buns! The coffee was great (and I am fussy with my coffee!) and they even had a pancake machine.While the location wasn't right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel.

"The hotel is a standard American motel, 3-star category. No frills here. The pool was crowded with European tourists. The grounds are nice, the air conditioning works well, internet is reasonably fast, the shower has decent pressure and drains well, the rooms were clean, it has a fridge, it's not too noisy, service was friendly enough. On the negative, breakfast is not included and service at the attached restaurant was exceedingly slow in the morning. Dinner was ok, but folks like to get going in the morning, and we waited 20 minutes before they even came to take our coffee orders. Also, there is no alcohol available in the entire town. I've never seen alcohol-free wine before I ate at the restaurant there. Tip: bring your own. Location is also pretty good, very close to the Canyon de Chelly visitor center but a few minutes outside the rest of Chinle.",Decent Stay,3
"The elevator still doesn't work and they have printed out pieces of paper everywhere saying things like: Press the elevator button just once, because it will get stuck and will stay on that floor. I think they could make better signs if that was really a problem. The room itself is ok. The sheets are very thin and you can see the mattress underneath. It was not very comfortable, but it wasn't horrible. It was clean and that was all I needed, but I wouldn't get it if I was staying in Spartanburg for more than a night. Breakfast is basic and simple, but it is free. I was surprised that when you walk in the doors are not automatic, you have to pull on the glass doors and try to hold it open while you pull your suitcase.","Ok place, good for an overnight stay",3
This hotel was a very good rate. We stayed here mid-september on a stop over trip to San Fran. The hotelroom had plenty of space for our family of 3 BUT it did smell really really musty.

"It was the luck of the draw that I picked the Monaco in downtown Alexandria. DC has always been a difficult, if not frightening experience for me. Then along came Kimpton's Hotel Monaco Alexandria. Our room was a single king. It came with a large flat panel TV, pre-filled goody shelf and fridge, Free WiFi, nice lounge and plenty of room. The decorating was tasteful, well done, and quite comfortable. The most exceptional part of the hotel, however, was the staff. It was obvious that they had been well trained from house keeping to management. All were polite, helpful and made us feel welcome and at home. The location is incredible. It is located on King St about 4 blocks up from the river and one more block from the Ferry stop. King St is the main artery that runs through the heart of old town Alexandria. The setting is beautiful and relatively quiet. There are shops and restaurants up and down both sides of the street for blocks. History abounds here so there is plenty to do just in the local area without going into DC. If you want to do the DC thing, there is a free trolley which runs every 15 min from 10am to 10pm the length of King St (20 blocks) to drop you off at the Metro station. You can pick up the blue line there which will take you to about any site you want to see or get to including National Airport. Old Alexandria is a very comfortable place to be. I felt at ease walking along King St any time of the day or night.",4 Star Accomodations in a 10 star location!!,5

Breakfast was very nice, with both the standard Holiday Inn Express fare and some nice additional surprises that provided a home-cooked quality. Staff members (sometimes as many as five or six) too often congregate to smoke on a bench located in the hotel's front driveway, adjacent to the front door. This does not provide a good first (or second or third) impression to guests, and the hotel management should definitely find a more secluded place for the ladies to smoke.",Reliable but Routine,4

"This is my first tripadvisor review and I feel I need to share my experience. The hotel and room is renovated and modern but we were assigned to an accessible room on first night which layout made us feel uncomfortable. They changed to a standard room for us next day but that room was not cleaned yet after we came back from the beach at 8pm and they wanted us to wait 30 minutes for the room to be cleaned because they did not have other room available. The guy (I forgot his name but he made me feel like lacks of experience) at front desk kept justifying it is their system issue (which means ok for customer). Even after room cleaned, we found hair on the bed and pillow smells and they only put 1 glass in our room. I choose Hyatt Centric because of their location, modern design and the quality of Hyatt (used to be), but this experience made me disappointed. Their staff definitely needs more training.Hi Brian C,Thank you for sharing your review of your stay with us in Waikiki. We apologize for the inconvenience with your room assignment.

"A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us.

"I like this place, even though it is a 30-minute commute to my work location, but the shuttle to Metro is convenient. This time one of the elevators was out of service with a note that it would be fixed the Monday of my arrival, but it was still out of commission when I left. The only drawback is the breakfast. One day, they added some sausage patties to the steamer table and it was actually cold--not even room temperature. It should have been heated first, because it appeared to be leftover from another day (and not just 1 day ago because the day before they had links, not patties). The last day, there wasn't even really meat. They had eggs, potatoes and grits along with corned beef hash, which is more of a potato entree--not a meat entree. For someone like myself, who doesn't eat potatoes, there was essentially no meat. Hopefully in the future, there will be plain meat--either bacon or sausage. I would not hesitate to come back here in the future.","Nice place, but breakfast is so-so.",4
"We've stayed here before due to its central location. On this multi-day visit we learned that a franchisee was assuming control and that had many of the staff very concerned, and they were vocal about this.

"It's a Marriott so you know the quality will be good. Attended a conference there in the fall so couldn't enjoy the courtyard pool as the weather was too cold. Kept too busy to really get the know the hotel but the standards you'd expect were there.Great breakfast buffet - but then again you pay big dullas for it... no different than any other 4 - 5 star. If you don't like planes, then stay away. The hotel is right under the final approach to one of O'Hare's runways. As one of the busiest airports worldwide, there's a big one on it's way down every few minutes. I sat on my balcony trying to have a conversation with a colleague eventually gave up went inside - the noise from the planes was just insane. The upside though is that you get a unique view of the belly of aircraft at low altitude. Interesting, even for that experience.Dear Swazimac - Thank you for taking the time to post a note regarding your recent stay at our hotel. We are delighted to hear that our recent 40 million investment of the hotel is being noticed as the hotel is a landmark in the area. Thank you also for the compliments in regards to food preparations. I am delighted to hear you enjoyed the breakfast buffet! But Im sorry to hear that your past stay was impacted by noise from air traffic. Unfortunately there is the occasional day when extreme weather conditions dictate that planes land at lower altitudes and I believe this may have had a big impact with regard to your stay. However, thermal pane windows in all of our guestrooms reduce noise factors. Should you find your travels back in Chicago and wish to stay with us again, please ask to be placed on a lower floor inside room. And fortunately, we are almost through the most severe rains Chicago has experienced in more than 50 years! Safe travels,",Plug your ears - planes on final approach,4

"First, some things that us question our choice: We arrived for a long stay around 10pm on a Friday and the lobby main door was locked... we had to use a bullet proof night window to check in (like a bank would have in a not so nice part of town). After feigning hearing issues with her behind glass, I asked to be let in the lobby and was let in and saw security camera monitors were pointed at every possible corner of the grounds. We got a room on the 3rd floor and the automatic door facing the hall to the rooms was broken. We had to walk all the way around the outside. We get to the elevator and its down for maintenance. I went back into the lobby and asked for a first floor room or second floor at least and she gave us one. When we got in the room though we were pleasantly surprised. The room looked updated for the most part with a nice granite counter outside the bathroom, counter height refrigerator and microwave. Horrible outdated tv though and ours had a loud screeching sound until it got warmed up. Bathroom was unbearably small. You had to step in and go behind the toilet to close the door. Outlets were lacking too. My husband and I both use our cell phones as alarms and want to plug in our phones next to the bed but there were not outlets anywhere near it. I had to unplug a lamp on the other side of the room. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast was blah but I wasn't expecting much from continental. Lo and behold, something else was broken! There are two Belgian waffle makers and one was out of order so we waited a very long time for our turn. Cereal, pastries, toast, coffee, etc. Every piece of fruit I got was a little past prime. Nothing to rave about.Overall, for the money, great deal and adequate for short hotel stay.",Just an okay hotel but red flags initially everywhere.,3
"I never made it to the room. There were customers in the lobby complaining and being refunded. Signs in the lobby about cash transactions and age restrictions made the hotel seem a little dicey. Finally, there was a skunk at the front door and a rat at the back.

After checking into the hotel, we returned our car early the night before our flight and Rose, the front desk lady suggested that we then take the shuttle from the car rental to the airport and they would pick us up with the hotel shuttle. What a fantastic idea. No bags to move out of the rental car.The room was comfortable and clean. I think the beds were the most comfortable on our trip. No refrigerator or microwave, but they do have a restaurant in the place that was most pleasant.We didn't use the pool, but it looked quite nice.The noise from the planes was not even heard due to the air conditioner in the room.Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments about your stay with us. It is our hope that you can visit us again soon the next time you visit Phoenix.Kind Regards,Griselda MenaAssistant Manager",Easy Place to Get to Airport,5
"This is an old downtown Hotel. I need a secure quiet place to sleep in on my long drive to NC. It fits the bill perfectly. Check in was quick and cordial. The elevator was old and worn but in good repair and worked fine it was probably slow and shaky at the time it was built. No problem for me. Room was clean and quiet, with worn furnishings, upgraded tight but functional bathroom, firm bed. I arrived late left early.",Surpisingly good for an old hotel,4
"We visit every year for wine tasting. The Richland Courtyard by Marriot is always a excellent experience. The rooms on the ground floor are especially nice with high ceilings. The riverside views are nice, but I prefer the other side as there is some traffic noise from the highway bridge, even though it's quite a distance away.",Always an enjoyable stay.,5

"This hotel was lovely , super clean with amazing rooms. Sea view rooms are to die for. The downside not of this hotel, but the area is that there are so many tramps in the area. Being situated right on the sea front the tramps congregate round the public toilets which are right outside the hotel. They do not hassle anyone though which is ok. There are a lot of homeless people in San Diego due to the weather ( as a local told us) , it was a bit of a shock to see so wish I'd been informed b4 we went there , hens I thought I'd put it on here. If you are in this area , please make use of the Bike Ride that you can do around the area , a great way to see the area. We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay, your room, and the ocean views! Thank you for taking the time to provide us with this feedback. We look forward to welcoming you back on your next trip to San Diego!",Lovely hotel shame about the tramps !,4

"The hotel is located across the street from the Space Needle. Its also within walking distance to Pike Place Market and other places along the wharf. The hotel is quiet. I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Thank you for the feedback regarding the clock in your suite.

"Great staff at this hotel. It's in a nice location too. The hotel is dated, but I very much enjoyed the breakfast at Denny's (ask for Ceci) as Best Western will give rewards members a free breakfast or 6.00 off another breakfast entree at Denneys. Bertha was fantastic as check in. She accommodated my special requests and took me to 3 rooms to let me decide as I told her I was super picky. Pierre and Michael and Darby were also super kind and helpful. Michael is very knowledgeable about wineries. Darby helped me with restaurants, and Pierre was also helpful and offered any additional assistance he could. Pierre had coffee made SUPER early which is great as I was up at 4 or 4:30 each day. It was nice he was there to greet me and there was decaf and coffee made early. They need to update the rooms, but the business center was nice with 2 computers and the exercise room and laundry facility was all right there too--super convenient. The price was high, but I guess all the prices are high at Napa. I'd recommend the location too. Thanks!",Staff was superb!,4

Hot food in the evening included hot dogs and chili.",Food isn't worth the extra cost.,4
"I stayed at the Orchard Garden last month, as business took me to San Francisco and there were literally no other hotel rooms available downtown between 75 and 450 per night some huge conference was going on and there was NO hotel availability. So I chose this hotel out of necessity (as I really had no choice), but was pleasantly surprised during my stay. The hotel is green, which I appreciate. Biodegradable bath product packaging (although the products themselves are still full of chemicals, boo), room key controlled lighting (very European), etc. The bathroom floor was heated (huge bonus in the morning) and the room was spacious enough. My view was of another close building, so that left a bit to be desired, and my room smelled of old lady perfume a little. I wasn't able to check out the rooftop garden but heard from a colleague that it's a great spot when the weather is nice. This hotel probably isn't my first choice for future trips to SF, as it was farther from my office than I'd like and I have other favorite hotels in the city, but it's definitely doable and I would stay here again if need be.Thank you for sharing your experience during your recent visit to San Francisco and our Hotel. Im thrilled you were pleasantly surprised during your stay and truly appreciate your feedback. Although it seems you enjoyed a majority of your stay, I am sincerely sorry about the lingering smell of the perfume. All of us here at the Orchard Garden Hotel would love if you decided to stay with us again. Thanks again Quinn McEntee Front Office Manager",Pleasantly surprising green hotel,3

For the price of the room the number of stars, I've stayed at a lot better places. Plus, the pool was super tiny more than a few guests in the pool made it seem like you were crashing someone else's party.

A/C was loud and did not control humidity. No sound barrier on ceiling sounded like elephants walking upstairs. Bathrooms were small. Door to room did not close securely unless forced.

"So, I am rating this based off of affordable hotels is Santa Cruz. If you want to be close to the boardwalk and the wharf this is a decent place to stay for under 200. I am pretty particular when I stay at a hotel, my favorite is holiday inn express or best western plus. I totally lower my expectations when I stay in Santa Cruz because I want to walk everywhere. We really only shower and sleep in the room. It has heating and air which is nice. I was happy it had a microwave and refrigerator, which my best western plus in Santa Barbara a day earlier did not.(Hard with a baby) It has free parking, just make sure your parking brake works properly! The bed was actually very, very comfortable. It's Santa Cruz, all the hotels are old and dingy unless you spring for a 500+ hotel.",Decent for Santa Cruz,3

"I stay in a lot of hotels, especially for work, and I have to say, this was probably the best one overall, in terms of layout and provisions. My room was big (plenty of room for yoga). It had a large window, which had two blinds, one of which was blackout and in rails. This was amazing- it actually blocked the light out so I could sleep. It is actually very rare to find a hotel that has proper curtains or blinds that fully block the light out. The bed was comfy, and it had squishy feather/down pillows, which I love. The layout of the room was great- the fridge was under the sink not in the bedroom (great that there was a fridge) the shower space was large and actually had a shelf on which to put your bathroom products! Amazing! And amazingly useful! The shower space was large enough that you could turn it on and not get wet, and your shower products were not in the water, either. The room had a big TV on the wall opposite the bed, which had lots of pillows cushions to sit up on watch TV. The desk was a useful size, and had a plug hub (both electricity USB) (yay!). My only two gripes about the room were that there was no top sheet, which I find is far too common in Europe sometimes the USA, and I will never understand, because it can be too hot for a duvet and that there was only one towel hook in the bathroom, which would be awkward if you were two people. I did had to ask for more coat hangers, although that was no problem. I really liked that if you didn't get your room made-up, you got a voucher for the food/bar. That covered my brekky every morning! I did have some issue with noisy guests on my floor, but of course that's not the hotel's fault. The bar is pretty nice, with some very tasty drinks (pineapple chipotle margarita, anyone!) and a good atmosphere.",One of the best hotel rooms I've stayed in,5

"Three of us stayed in the hotel during the recent AARP convention. It is difficult to find a room to hold 3 who want individual beds. We had 2 queens and a roll away and the room was not crowded. This has huge rooms and we never felt tight. Anytime we called to ask questions of the front desk, out concern was taken care of within minutes and questions answered immediately. The trolley in front was out of service, but the trolley on Canal street and buses are minutes away. You can get every where on these modes of transportation or on foot. Everyone in this city is so friendly and willing to aid tourists. If I ever visited New Orleans again, I would not stay anywhere else.This hotel does not have a pool or spa. It also does not have a restaurant, however there are 100s aroundThank you so much for staying with us during your AARP convention I am so pleased you guys enjoyed your stay!
